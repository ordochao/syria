media/greenslade/2011/mar/28/reuters-syria,2011-03-28,Reuters journalists missing in Syria,"Two Reuters television journalists have been missing in Syria since Saturday night. Lebanese-based producer Ayat Basma and cameraman Ezzat Baltaji had been expected back in Beirut after sending a message to colleagues. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] They had crossed the border into Syria two days before to cover the protests against to President Bashar al-Assad's 11-year rule. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Reuters editor-in-chief Stephen Adler said the agency was deeply concerned about the journalists. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A senior Reuters editor is planning to go to Damascus to discuss the matter with Syrian officials. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] On Friday, Syrian authorities withdrew the accreditation of Reuters correspondent Khaled Yacoub Oweis, claiming he had filed 'unprofessional and false' coverage of events.

world/2012/may/27/syria-roll-call-civilian-slaughter,2012-05-27,Syria joins roll call of civilian slaughter,"At noon on Friday, they gathered for their familiar and increasingly futile weekly ritual – an act of peaceable defiance against the regime they loathe. The chants resounded far and wide, audible to the army troops menacingly nearby and to the adjoining Allawite villages largely sympathetic to the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. 'The Allawites have been hearing our chants for many months,' said Houla resident Abu Jaffour. 'And neither they, nor the army have liked what we've been saying. Maybe that's why they did what they did.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Three hours later, vengeance rolled into town with a savagery rarely paralleled in the 15-month Syrian uprising. When the shelling and gunfire stopped early on Saturday, more than 90 people had been killed, at least one-third of them children. Some appeared to have been killed at close range as they cowered in barricaded homes. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In a few short hours, the town of Houla joined the sorry list of localities whose names have become synonymous with the merciless slaughter of civilians. Srebrenica. Nyarubuye. My Lai. Up to now, the Syrian conflict has killed 13,000 people. But until this weekend, it had yet to include the mass slaughter of nursery-age infants. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'The shelling started around 3pm,' said Abu Jaffour. 'I was in the fields at the time and we tried to reach the area being bombed. It took us three hours to get there. When I reached the houses it was dreadful. I was carrying babies' bodies that had parts of their heads hanging out.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A second Houla resident, Imm Mowafik, said that nightfall brought more brutality. 'The Shabiha [pro-regime civilian militias] came into town from the direction of the Allawite villages. They entered from five to seven checkpoints and were killing people in their homes. We could hear the shots and nobody could help them.' Abu Jaffour said: 'We have buried around 110 martyrs and there are still some people under the rubble. Twenty-two of the children are nursery age.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Last night, the UN security council convened an emergency session to discuss what the White House called a 'vile testament to an illegitimate regime'. The foreign secretary, William Hague, will arrive in Moscow on Monday to take up the matter with Assad's closest security council ally, Russia. The UN special envoy to Syria, Kofi Annan, whose tattered peace plan remains in effect on paper alone, will head for Damascus on an emergency mission to stop the crisis from unravelling even further. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'This appalling and brutal crime involving indiscriminate and disproportionate use of force is a flagrant violation of international law and of the commitments of the Syrian government to cease the use of heavy weapons in population centres and violence in all its forms,' the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said before Annan's visit. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syria on Sunday denied it was responsible, blaming al-Qaida for the carnage – a refrain it repeats after all large bombings and shootings. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'Al-Qaida hiding in the mountains?' asked Abu Jaffour. 'They expect people to believe that? These mountain areas are the Allawite villages and Houla is full of the families of the Free Syrian Army [FSA].' Like much of the rest of Homs province in central Syria, Houla had become a hub of armed opposition to the Assad regime, which is trying to repress the most sustained challenge to its four decades of rule. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Houla residents claim that 600 defectors are in Houla. If true, the small town of 35,000 residents would be a stronghold of the opposition militia, in the area now known as the heartland of the Syrian revolution. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The battle has become increasingly sectarian. Syria's third city, Homs, and its surrounding hinterland is a patchwork of Allawite and Sunni enclaves and tensions between the sects have increasingly spilled over into violence. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Several observers say the violence in Homs has developed a clear pattern. 'All of these areas that have been attacked like this are geographically and demographically close to Allawite areas,' said Wissam Tarif, the Arab world campaigner for the global rights group Avaaz. 'There have been 13 neighbourhoods of Homs emptied,' he said. 'There are residents there but they are not significant populations. The common denominator in these areas is that they are close to Allawite communities. There are hundreds of thousands of people on the move. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'This is not just some angry guys who went and killed these families. This is a state policy, a regime policy, spreading sectarian tensions. People in Houla are going to retaliate. They will enter into yet another cycle of violence.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A third resident of Houla said that more than three-quarters of the population of the town was now on the move, with many travelling to rural areas to escape fighting which was continuing on Sunday night. 'They are sleeping in their fields,' said the man who identified himself as Abu Wael. 'Another 10,000 have moved into the homes of families in other parts of Houla.' Syrian opposition towns visited by UN monitors say the officials have been slow to respond and given little room to independently assess flashpoint areas. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Annan had struck a deal with Damascus for 300 monitors to be allowed into Syria. However less than half have so far arrived. 'It now needs to be 3,000,' said Tarif.",Martin Chulov,The Guardian
world/2011/aug/13/assad-tanks-rebel-towns-syrian,2011-08-13,Assad orders tanks into rebel towns as Syria's brutal crackdown intensifies,"Syrian tanks and gunmen have swept through two towns to root out anti-government protesters amid heavy firing that has sent many fleeing to safer areas. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Three people were reported to have died in the violence, the latest in an escalating campaign of repression by President Bashar al-Assad's regime against an uprising that erupted in mid-March. The heaviest assault was reported in the coastal city of Latakia, where a day earlier thousands turned out to demand the president's removal. At least 20 tanks and armoured personnel fanned out into the city's el-Ramel district as intense gunfire rang out, according to Rami Abdul-Rahman, the head of the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Shooting and explosions were also heard in the town's Slaibeh neighbourhood, according to the Observatory and the Local Co-ordination Committees of Syria, an activist group that documents protests. Two people were killed in the shooting, they said. Scores of security agents and pro-government gunmen, known as Shabiha, entered the town of Qusair, near the border with Lebanon, and several nearby villages, arresting scores of residents, Abdul-Rahman said. LCC Syria said that one person was killed in the shooting. It was not possible to verify the reports. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The army also conducted an operation in the nearby towns of Hawla and Taldaw, in the central Homs province, and deployed tanks in the area, activists said. They reported that 10 people were wounded by gunfire during sweeps in the north-western town of Sarmin. Both the al-Ramel section of Latakia and Qusair have seen large protests since the demonstrations began in March. Government efforts to quash the protests have intensified in recent weeks, with troops storming several towns and cities. Abdul-Rahman said that many residents, mostly women and children, were fleeing to safer areas. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In protests around the country on Friday, tens of thousands called for Assad's death, in a dramatic escalation of anger. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Crowds took to the streets after Friday prayers, defying bullets and rooftop snipers following more than a week of intensified military assaults on rebel cities. The chants calling for Assad's death are seen as a sign of how much the protest movement has changed since its initial demands for minor reform, but not for regime change. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The protests have grown dramatically over the past five months, driven in part by anger over the government's bloody crackdown in which rights groups say at least 1,700 civilians have been killed. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The government has justified its crackdown by saying it is dealing with terrorist gangs and criminals who are fomenting unrest.",Barry Neild and agencies,The Guardian
media/greenslade/2012/feb/22/sundaytimes-syria,2012-02-22,Marie Colvin killed in Syria,"Marie Colvin, the award-winning Sunday Times journalist, has been killed in Syria. It is reported that she died alongside a French photographer in Homs when a house they were staying was shelled. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] News agencies say she and the photographer, Remi Ochlik, another veteran war correspondent, were killed by a rocket as they tried to make their escape. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Three other foreign journalists were also reportedly wounded, including Paul Conroy, a British photographer who was working with Colvin. A French reporter with Le Figaro, Edith Bouvier, was injured. The third, a female American journalist who has not been named, was said to be 'in a very serious condition.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] They were all apparently inside a makeshift media centre set up by anti-regime activists in the Baba Amr district that took a direct hit from a shell. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Colvin, who has worn a trademark black eye patch since losing an eye after being hit by shrapnel on assignment in Sri Lanka in 2001, was regarded as Britain's foremost front-line war reporter. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In a BBC broadcast yesterday, she described the bloodshed as 'absolutely sickening'. She said: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'I watched a little baby die today. Absolutely horrific. There is just shells, rockets and tank fire pouring into civilian areas of this city and it is just unrelenting.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In a report published in the Sunday Times over the weekend, Colvin wrote of the citizens of Homs 'waiting for a massacre'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] She wrote: 'The scale of human tragedy in the city is immense. The inhabitants are living in terror. Almost every family seems to have suffered the death or injury of a loved one... [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'On the lips of everyone was the question: 'Why have we been abandoned by the world?'' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] She was in a pro-opposition area of Homs that has been under sustained bombardment from government forces since 3 February, causing the deaths of several hundred people. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Sunday Times's editor, John Witherow, issued a statement in which he spoke of Colvin as 'an extraordinary figure in the life of the Sunday Times' who was 'driven by a passion to cover wars in the belief that what she did mattered. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'She believed profoundly that reporting could curtail the excesses of brutal regimes and make the international community take notice... [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'Throughout her long career she took risks to fulfil this goal, including being badly injured in Sri Lanka. Nothing seemed to deter her. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'But she was much more than a war reporter. She was a woman with a tremendous joie de vivre, full of humour and mischief and surrounded by a large circle of friends, all of whom feared the consequences of her bravery.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Rupert Murdoch also paid tribute to Colvin, describing her as 'one of the most outstanding foreign correspondents of her generation.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] He said that often put her life in danger 'because she was driven by a determination that the misdeeds of tyrants and the suffering of the victims should not go unreported.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In 2010, Colvin spoke about the dangers of reporting on war zones at a Fleet Street ceremony honouring fallen journalists. She said: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'Craters. Burned houses. Mutilated bodies. Women weeping for children and husbands. Men for their wives, mothers, children [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Our mission is to report these horrors of war with accuracy and without prejudice. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We always have to ask ourselves whether the level of risk is worth the story. What is bravery, and what is bravado? [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Journalists covering combat shoulder great responsibilities and face difficult choices. Sometimes they pay the ultimate price.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Colvin twice won the British press award as the best foreign correspondent. Among her other awards were one for courage in journalism by the International Women's Media Foundation and the Foreign Press Association's journalist of the year award. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] She wrote and produced the BBC documentary Arafat: Behind the Myth and presented a documentary on Martha Gellhorn, the war correspondent renowned for her coverage of the Spanish civil war. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Ochlik, 28, had been covering conflicts for eight years, firstly in Haiti, and most recently the revolutions in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya. He won a world press photo award for his Libyan work. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] French television reporter Gilles Jacquier was killed in Homs last month as a shell exploded amid a group of journalists covering protests in the city on a visit organised by the Syrian authorities.

world/2012/apr/21/un-authorises-syria-monitors,2012-04-21,UN authorises 300 Syria monitors,"The UN security council has unanimously voted to send 300 unarmed military observers to Syria to monitor the fragile ceasefire between President Bashar al-Assad's forces and opposition groups. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The resolution approved on Saturday increases the number of observers in the UNSMIS mission from 30 and demands an immediate halt to the violence that has been escalating since a ceasefire took effect over a week ago. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] It also authorises the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, to decide when to deploy the additional observers based on 'relevant developments on the ground, including the cessation of violence'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The resolution noted that the cessation of violence by the government and opposition was 'clearly incomplete'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The British foreign secretary, William Hague, said he welcomed the mission and called for a full end to violence in the country. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'This resolution increases the pressure on the Syrian regime to begin a transition to a democratic, plural political system. I welcome the fact that the council reaffirmed its full support for this goal,' he said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'However, I remain extremely concerned that the Syrian regime is still failing to meet its commitments, and that there has been further violence and the use of heavy weapons since 12 April when a ceasefire should have come into effect. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'The Syrian regime must stop immediately troop movements towards population centres; end the use of heavy weapons in civilian areas; and withdraw the military to their barracks. The Syrian regime must ensure that the UN monitoring mission can operate freely and safely, and this must include agreement on the use of air assets.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Hague called for the full implementation of Kofi Annan's six-point peace plan, which includes starting a Syrian-led political process to address the concerns of the Syrian people and the right to demonstrate peacefully as well as a UN-supervised ceasefire. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'If the Syrian regime fails to take these steps and to comply with Kofi Annan's plan in full, we will push for further action, including in the UN security council,' Hague said.",Jo Adetunji and agencies,The Guardian
world/2013/jan/29/syrian-rebels-bodies-aleppo-canal,2013-01-29,Syrian rebels recover scores of bodies from Aleppo river as floodwaters recede,"Rebel groups in Aleppo say they have recovered more than 100 bodies from a small river in the south of the city and say more are yet to be dragged from the water after what appears to be one of the biggest massacres to have taken place in the war-ravaged city. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A video posted online today showed rows of bodies, most of them men in their 20s and 30s, with their hands tied behind their backs and evident bullet wounds to their heads. The graphic footage showed blood seeping from the corpses across silt left on the watercourse's concrete bank by floodwaters that have recently receded. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] One witness at the scene said he counted 108 bodies and rebel groups said they expected the final death toll to climb to as many as 120, though the Guardian was unable to independently verify the number of dead. The corpses were found on Tuesday morning in Bustan al-Qasr, in the southern city centre. The site is near one of several frontlines that divides opposition groups in the east and south of Aleppo from loyalist forces in the north. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Where the men were executed is not yet clear. Winter rain has given the river a strong current in recent weeks and initial assessments suggested that the bodies could have been carried some distance. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Syrian regime blamed 'terrorist gangs' for the killings, a term it uses for all groups fighting against it. A regime official in Damascus suggested that rebel groups were now leading a recovery in an attempt to 'cover for their crimes'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A Syrian official told Agence France Presse: 'We will disclose the identities of those killed as soon as we are able to secure the bodies, which is a difficult process since the area is in the hands of terrorist groups.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Rebel groups, however, blamed the Syrian government for the killings, suggesting that some of the victims had crossed into loyalist areas then disappeared. None of the victims had identification cards. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Residents of rebel-held eastern Aleppo have reportedly arrived at the site where the bodies were found to try to identify missing relatives. The remains were loaded into trucks and taken to the nearby Zarzur Hospital, where rebel officials were trying to organise an identification process. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A resident of rebel-held eastern Aleppo who called himself Omar al-Halabi told the Guardian that 11 bodies had been identified by nightfall and claimed by their families for burial. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'Their relatives said that they live in ... areas under the control of the FSA like Ansari, Sukari and Al-Bustan districts,' he said. 'None were members of the Free Syria Army [FSA]. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'I spoke to a guy who was able to identify his brother and his friend's bodies,' he said. '[He] said that his brother and his friend were heading to one of the districts which are still under the control of the Syrian army in Aleppo and they did not come back three days ago. These two men were in their fifties. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'Other bodies were identified by their relatives who said that they had been detained at the Air Force Intelligence headquarters in Aleppo 10 days ago.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] An eyewitness to the recovery effort said several bullets were fired during the day from buildings to the north. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Extrajudicial killings have become increasingly frequent in many parts of Syria over the past six months. However, Tuesday's death toll in Aleppo is believed to be without precedent in the city since rebels launched an assault there in July. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In the months since then, the opposition has entrenched itself in the east of the city and the regime has hunkered down in the north-west. The south-western suburbs of Saif al-Dawli and Salahedin remain battleground areas. Few residents cross the divide, which is manned on one side by Syrian soldiers and sniper positions and on the other by rebel groups. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] As fighting and atrocities continue, Syrian citizens are leaving the country in increasing numbers. Over the past six weeks, an extra 200,000 refugees have sought shelter in Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan and Iraq, the UN High Commission for Refugees said on Tuesday. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] More than 700,000 people have now fled Syria, the UN said, with 21,000 crossing into Jordan in the past week alone – about five times the number seen in previous weeks. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The UN has appealed for $1.5bn (£950m) in aid to fund shelter, food and education for Syrian refugees but says it has so far been able to secure only 3% of that figure from international donors. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] With the violence in Syria showing no sign of abating, aid needs are likely to intensify in the first half of the year at least. At least another 1.5 million Syrians are believed to be internally displaced. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] While some food aid, as well as homegrown fresh produce, has been delivered to battle zones such as Aleppo in recent weeks, there is no guarantee that supply lines can continue to be secured. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Fighting erupts near flashpoint areas of Aleppo most days. The site where the bodies were found is one such area, considered a no-go zone for the few remaining locals.

world/2011/nov/15/syria-urged-stop-repression,2011-11-15,Syria urged to stop violent repression,"Syria came under mounting pressure from Turkey and Arab Gulf states on Tuesday to ease its violent repression of protests a day before a historic move to suspend its Arab League membership. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Human rights groups and monitors reported that up to 70 people were killed in clashes on Monday, with a total of 140 dead since the Arab League voted on Saturday to suspend Syria's membership. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] As the death toll continued to rise, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish prime minister, urged Syria's government to 'turn back from the edge of the cliff'. He threatened to cut electricity supplies to its southern neighbour if its president, Bashar al-Assad – 'feeding on blood' – did not change course. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Turkey's president, Abdullah Gul, added: 'Unfortunately, Syria today has entered a dead end.' Turkey also announced the suspension of joint oil exploration with Syria. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that 19 unidentified corpses were delivered to a hospital in the central city of Homs. It said the bodies could be people kidnapped by loyalist militiamen. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Meanwhile, the Syrian Revolution General Commission, an activist group, reported seven named individuals killed. Video clips posted online showed mutilated corpses and people being beaten. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Citizens of Homs described 'vicious and unbelievable fighting' in bitterly contested parts of the city. Two residents told the Guardian that defections of members of the security forces had risen sharply since the league vote's. That decision appears to have encouraged demonstrators in Homs and Deraa, where 34 government troops are thought to have been ambushed on Monday night. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'Especially in the past two days there have been many defections,' said one resident. 'We are especially seeing young ones and we are starting to see officers. There have been 50-60 in our area alone.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syrian officials are forcing government workers to join mass rallies across the country on Wednesday in support of the regime. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Assad's growing isolation was underlined again when the six members of the Saudi-led Gulf Co-operation Council rebuffed his call for an emergency Arab summit to discuss the crisis. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Russia, however, refused to back demands by Assad's opponents to support them against the regime. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The suspension, called 'shameful and malicious' by Damascus, is due to take effect on Wednesday as foreign ministers meet in Morocco. League rules require 15 of the 22 members to back an emergency summit. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] On Monday King Abdullah of Jordan became the first Arab leader to call publicly for Assad to step down. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The meeting in Rabat, the Moroccan capital, is likely to discuss fresh economic and further political sanctions on Syria. But new divisions are likely to emerge and constrain further collective action. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Sudan, one of the 18 Arab countries which backed Syria's suspension, indicated it wanted to mend fences. Egypt and several other member states have ignored a league call to withdraw ambassadors from Damascus. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Russia, meanwhile, urged the Syrian National Council (SNC), the largest anti-Assad opposition group, to talk to the regime. Burhan Ghalioun, the Paris-based SNC leader, said the opposition would only talk to those whose hands were not stained with blood. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Russia has said the Arab League was wrong to suspend Syria and opposed any move by the UN security council to condemn the Assad regime. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Ghalioun said: 'We were unable to change the position of the Russian government, and they also could not change our position.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In Kuwait 33 MPs called on the government to recognise the SNC – in a move which would parallel recognition of the Benghazi-based Libyan rebels of the National Transitional Council while Muammar Gaddafi was in power. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syrian officials claimed to have freed 1,100 political prisoners ahead of Wednesday's league meeting. The release of all prisoners seized since the uprising began on 15 March was a key condition of a deal struck two weeks ago, which Syria has not honoured. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] An end to the crackdown had also been a key demand. But November is on track to be the bloodiest month of the uprising. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The global rights group, Avaaz, said it has compiled figures showing that 4,203 people have been killed since March – 700 more than UN figures say. Avaaz says its researchers used testimony from three people, including a relative of each victim, to collate its figures. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Ricken Patel, executive director of Avaaz, said: 'After an 8 month horror show that has left thousands dead and tortured, the Arab League and China are, at last, taking action on Syria. Russia is now the lone remaining power shilling for Assad, and will face intense public and diplomatic pressure to stop blocking effective UN measures.'","Ian Black, Middle East editor and Martin Chulov in Beirut",The Guardian
commentisfree/2011/may/18/barack-obama-middle-east-speech,2011-05-18,Mission impossible: Barack Obama's Middle East speech | Simon Tisdall,"Barack Obama is good at speeches. He proved it in Cairo in 2009, when he tried to mend post-Iraq fences with the Muslim world. He did it again at the UN last September, calling for an Israel-Palestine peace deal within a year. But Obama's speech on Thursday, when he will attempt to articulate a coherent American view of the Arab spring, plus ongoing problems in Palestine and Iran, looks like mission impossible – even for a man with his intellectual and oratorical skills. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Far from being more peaceful than two years ago, the Middle East is experiencing tumultuous upheavals, which have largely reduced Obama to the role of bemused spectator. When the US has intervened, it has done so tentatively, with mixed results. Obama's belated support for ousting Hosni Mubarak, for example, left Egypt's revolutionaries unimpressed. But it deeply upset Saudi Arabia's rulers, who concluded he could not be trusted. And it has resulted in a government in Cairo less inclined to do Washington's bidding. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Obama's backing for military intervention in Libya was conditional from the outset. As the war drags on, his attitude appears ever more ambivalent. The opportunity to topple old enemy Muammar Gaddafi on the cheap – a key motivator – was lost in the rubble of Misrata. At the same time Obama is accused of hypocrisy for not moving militarily against Syria's President Bashar al-Assad or Bahrain's King Hamad al-Khalifa. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] As for Israel-Palestine, Obama's peace drive has run into the sand – a fact underscored by the weekend resignation of Middle East peace envoy, George Mitchell. In a two-year trial of strength with Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, the president has come off worse. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Netanyahu will travel to Washington this week to give some speeches of his own. He will claim the recent Fatah-Hamas reconciliation deal makes it impossible to negotiate with the Palestinians (since half their joint leadership is dedicated to Israel's destruction). He will also resurrect the spectre of the Iranian 'threat', in his view the region's most pressing problem. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas, defying Obama, is meanwhile stepping up the campaign for UN general assembly recognition of an independent, sovereign Palestinian state within the 1967 borders – a move that could provoke an autumn of confrontation with Israel. A foretaste came with the weekend Naqba anniversary violence. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] So what to do? White House officials suggest Obama will express support for Arab pro-democracy movements in general but stick to a pragmatic, mostly hands-off, case-by-case approach rather than try to set out a new, overarching strategy. 'He believes the future of the region will be written by the people of the region and that what we're seeing is an expression of long pent-up desire for greater freedom, greater prosperity, and greater engagement in the political process in these countries,' said White House press secretary Jay Carney. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] This 'realist' approach was praised by leading Middle East analyst Aaron David Miller, writing in Foreign Policy. 'The last thing America needs is a doctrine or ideological template to govern how it responds to fast-breaking changes in a dozen Arab countries, all of which are strikingly different in their respective circumstances,' he said. In Syria, Miller said, 'Obama is worried about creating a worse situation if Assad falls'. Libya, on the other hand, was different. 'Beating up Gaddafi proved doable and necessary to prevent … potential atrocities in Benghazi.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Rami Khouri, writing in Lebanon's Daily Star, said Washington's pick-and-choose approach was unacceptable to most Arabs, reflecting 'the same old, ugly problem of double standards in western governments' treatment of Arab issues'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Obama should adhere to two principles, Khouri said. 'The first point is to appreciate the Arab spring is a long-term process and not to recoil and then retrench in the company of known dictators and ruling thugs once the momentum for democratic change slows down'. Secondly, Obama should declare that 'liberty is the birthright of all human beings and the US supports the absolute and undifferentiated right of all those who struggle … to achieve and enjoy those rights, including Arabs and Iranians'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] If Obama's handling of the Arab spring seems doomed to disappoint many in the region, his apparent lack of new ideas on Israel-Palestine may prove downright provocative, especially to those who want him to squeeze Netanyahu. According to Robert Danin of the US Council on Foreign Relations, Mitchell's resignation confirmed 'the goal of an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement by September is unattainable and negotiations are not about to resume any time soon'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Others are now urging the US and Israel to close ranks, arguing that ongoing Arab instability, European weakness and increasingly strained alliances with Egypt and others mean the two countries need each other more than ever. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'As Iran's malign influence spreads and Turkey turns away from the west, Israel's strategic value to the US and pro-western Arab governments will surely increase,' said Michael Oren, Israel's ambassador to Washington, writing in Foreign Policy. 'Secretary of state Alexander Haig's observation 30 years ago still resonates today: 'Israel is the largest American aircraft carrier in the world that cannot be sunk … and is located in a critical region for American national security'.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Obama certainly agrees with this idea of Israel the indispensable ally. He has said so on numerous occasions. Probably he will say so again in Thursday's speech. Which again raises the question: why does he bother if he has nothing new to say?",Simon Tisdall,The Guardian
world/2012/aug/26/syria-accused-civilian-massacre-daraya,2012-08-26,Syrian regime accused of massacre of 200 civilians in Daraya,"Syrian government troops have been accused of a massacre of civilians in Daraya, a town on the outskirts of Damascus which the regime retook from rebels on Saturday. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Local Co-ordination Committees (LCC), an opposition network, claimed more than 200 bodies had been found in the working-class Sunni community south-west of the capital, and activists circulated a video appearing to show dozens of bodies, mostly of young men, lined up in dimly lit rooms, described in the commentary as being in the town's Abu Suleiman al-Durani mosque. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The government portrayed the attack as a counter-terrorism operation. 'Our heroic armed forces cleansed Daraya from remnants of armed terrorist groups,' the state news agency said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Britain's foreign office minister for the Middle East, Alistair Burt, said that if the reports were verified, 'it would be an atrocity on a new scale, requiring unequivocal condemnation from the entire international community'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The storming of Daraya on Saturday followed three days of heavy bombardment by government tanks and artillery, which the opposition said killed a further 70 people. The offensive appeared to be part of a larger struggle for control of the southern fringe of the capital. Local residents said that government tanks on the Damascus ring road shelled the neighbourhoods of al-Lawwan and Nahr Aisheh late into Saturday night and that there was also heavy fighting in the Ghouta suburbs to the east of the city. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The LCC said forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad had killed a total of 440 people across Syria on Saturday alone. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based activist group drawing information from a network of monitors across Syria, put the nationwide death toll for the day at 370 including 174 civilians. If confirmed, it is one of the bloodiest days the country has suffered since the anti-Assad revolt broke out in March 2011. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] It was impossible to verify such claims because of severe Syrian government restrictions on independent or foreign media coverage. A United Nations report this month into an earlier massacre at Houla found that the indiscriminate attacks against civilian populations and other atrocities were 'state policy' and claimed Assad's forces and allied 'Shabiha' militia were involved at the highest levels in 'gross violation of international human rights'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The UN enquiry found that anti-Assad forces had also committed war crimes including 'murder, extrajudicial execution and torture' but that these abuses 'did not reach the gravity, frequency and scale of those committed by government forces and the Shabiha.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A new Amnesty Report on the fighting in Aleppo, Syria's largest city, also found: 'The overwhelming majority of victims were killed in air strikes and artillery attacks by government forces.' But it criticised rebels for using imprecise or indiscriminate weapons such as mortars and home-made rockets. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Activists in Daraya alleged that most of the victims had been summarily executed by government troops moving from house to house. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'Assad's army has committed a massacre in Daraya,' said Abu Kinan, an activist in the town, told Reuters news agency by telephone, using an alias to protect himself from reprisals. 'In the last hour, 122 bodies were discovered and it appears that two dozen died from sniper fire and the rest were summarily executed by gunshots from close range,' he said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The activist said he witnessed the death of an eight-year-old girl, Asma Abu al-Laban, shot by army snipers while she was in a car with her parents. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'They were trying to flee the army raids. Three bullets hit her in the back and her parents brought her to a makeshift hospital. Nothing could be done for her,' he said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A thorough investigation of atrocity claims can only be carried out by the international criminal court in the the Hague if it is given a mandate by the UN security council, but that has been blocked by Russia, the Assad regime's principal backer and arms supplier, together with China. Moscow and Beijing have also vetoed resolutions threatening Assad with sanctions for non-compliance with a peace plan backed by the UN and the Arab League. The last UN monitors in Damascus left earlier this month when the security council failed to agree on a new mandate for them. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Western officials say they have largely given up on security council diplomacy and are stepping up their assistance to the fragmented opposition, though they say that assistance stops short of weapons. However, Saudi Arabia and Qatar are reported to be shipping arms to rebel groups as the conflict continues to escalate. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Iran is the regime's only major ally in the region and Iranian officials have said that Revolutionary Guards have fought alongside Assad's troops. Syria's Vice-President Farouk al-Sharaa met an Iranian delegation on Sunday, according to Syria's state news agency, marking his first appearance in several weeks. It put an end to opposition rumours that he had defected. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In the increasingly daunting search for a diplomatic solution, the UN and Arab League have appointed a new special envoy, a veteran Algerian diplomat, Lakhdar Brahimi, after the resignation of the former UN secretary general Kofi Annan. On Friday, Brahimi declared himself 'honoured, flattered, humbled and scared' to be given the job.

world/middle-east-live/2011/dec/30/syria-egypt,2011-12-30,Syrian forces clash with protesters in key cities – Friday 30 December 2011,"11.04am: Good Morning. Welcome to the Middle East Live blog and the last Friday of 2011, the year when the Middle East was riven with popular uprising. Here's a round-up and look forward to today's events. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Syria: Activists have called for mass nationwide protests today as Arab League monitors prepare to spend their first Friday in the country visiting some of its most volatile cities. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Rallying calls have been made through all the Syrian revolution's channels and crowds are now gathering in Deraa, the southern city renowned as ground zero of the revolt. Mass rallies are also planned in Idlib, where loyalist forces have this week battled defectors, killing dozens, and in Douma, which is increasingly becoming a focal point of the push to oust the regime of president Bashar al-Assad. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Prelimanary reports which the Guardian has not been able to verify suggest that there is shooting taking place in Damascus and in Hama. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Egypt: Twenty eight Egyptian human rights groups have signed a statement accusing the country's ruling military council of using Hosni Mubarak-era 'repressive tools' in waging an 'unprecedented campaign' against pro-democracy organisations. The groups' joint statement came just hours after security forces stormed offices of 10 rights organisations, including several based in the US. The interior ministry said the raids were part of the investigation into foreign funding of rights groups. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 11.20am: Reuters is reporting that the anti-government Free Syrian Army has been ordered to stop offensive operations pending a meeting with Arab League delegates but the armed group is having serious trouble making contact with Arab League delegates. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The rebels' commander, Colonel Riad al-Asaad said his forces had so far been unable to talk to the monitors, in the first week of their month-long mission, and he was still trying to contact them urgently. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'I issued an order to stop all operations from the day the committee entered Syria last Friday. All operations against the regime are to be stopped except in a situation of self defence.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'We have tried to communicate with them and we requested a meeting with the team. So far there hasn't been any success. We haven't been given any of the (phone) numbers for the monitors, which we have requested. No one has contacted us either.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 11.24am:This video posted on Youtube earlier today purports to show the start of a demonstration in the Hamediya neighbourhood of Hama, Syria. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] . [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 11.42am: This is from the Associated Press news wire which is reporting that German officials have complained to the Egyptian ambassador over what they describe as an unacceptable raid on the Cairo office of a German thinktank. This adds to the condemnation from the US overnight. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Konrad Adenauer Foundation, which has links to Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, was among 10 pro-democracy organizations whose offices were raided on Thursday. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] German Foreign Ministry spokesman Andreas Peschke said Egypt's ambassador in Berlin was summoned to the ministry on Friday. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Peschke said he was told that it was 'unacceptable for the work of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation in Egypt to be hindered in this way' and that Berlin believes authorities' actions go against the spirit of a German-Egyptian agreement in August on a partnership to support building Egyptian democracy. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 11.44am: It appears that the call put out by Syrian activists for mass demonstrations across the country has been heeded. Reports and videos suggest that there are significant demonstrations in Aleppo, Hama, Damascus and Deraa. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] This video puports to have been shot earlier today in Aleppo: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 11.56am: Russia is backing the Arab League monitors' mission describing the situation in Syria as 'reassuring'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'Moscow appraises with satisfaction the real beginning of the Arab League activities in Syria,' the Russian foreign ministry has said in a statement. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Russian government which has recently faced its own popular protest movement over contested election results also commented on the monitors' visit to Homs the scenes of some of the worst violence against civillians in recent months. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The foreign ministry added: 'The situation there is reassuring, clashes have not been recorded.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Local Coordination Committees, an activist coalition, said at least 130 people, including six children, have been killed in Syria since the Arab observers began their one-month mission on Tuesday. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 12.35pm: The UN has now moved to condemn raids conducted by Egyptian security services on NGO's yesterday. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Ravina Shamdasani, spokeswoman for the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, said the raids seem 'clearly designed to intimidate human rights defenders who have long been critical of human rights violations in Egypt, including under the previous regime.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Shamdasani said prominent non-governmental organizations complained their files were searched and seized and staff prevented from leaving as the raids were conducted late Thursday, adding that the measures were 'unnecessarily heavy-handed'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] She said there have been 'many such incidents in recent months where measures have been taken to interfere in the work of NGOs.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 12.43pm: This from our correspondent Luke Harding who has been speaking to Heba Morayef, Human Rights Watch researcher for the Middle East and North Africa, about yesterday's raids on NGOs in Egypt. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Morayef, who is in Cairo, says she fears that more NGOs could be targeted by the country's military rulers in the next few days. She says that in addition to the raids on 17 premises yesterday police also turned up at an old address for the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies. The organisation moved to a new office two years ago, she said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'We know that there are some other organisations that are going to be next. They might go for other organisations today. They might wait until Sunday,' she said. Morayef said the unprecedented 'broad-based' attack on US, German and Egyptian civic society groups was dismaying, with nothing similar attempted during former president Hosni Mubarak's three decades in power. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'I think it's been pretty shocking. If this carries on there could be a shut-down of the whole human rights community in Egypt. We don't know quite know what will happen next,' she warned. None of the NGOs were functioning, with offices today sealed, she said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Morayef said that regime officials were exploiting repressive and vague Mubarak-era laws to clamp down on civil society organisations: 'You have the entire bureaucracy of Mubarak's regime still in place. We have educated officials saying with a straight face 'You have to respect the law''. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] She added that Egypt's ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces seemed to 'genuinely believe' that 'foreign hands' were behind Egypt's revolution and continuing popular uprising. She also said she was deeply concerned about an on-going investigation into NGOs by two judges, on behalf of Egypt's prosecutor. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 1.15pm: Our correspondent Martin Chulov across the border in Beirut, Lebanon has this to say about today's Syrian demonstrations. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syrian activists promised that today would be a highly visible show of defiance. And they've delivered. Today's protests are significant, not because of the overall numbers, which will become more apparent later in the day, but because of the range of locations in which they're taking place. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The pre-Assad regime flag adopted by the demonstrators is being waved in demonstrations in many areas of Damascus, including Midan, Douma and al-Qadam, despite attempts by security forces to stop all gatherings. There are large protest in the second city, Aleppo, as well as Idlib, Latakia, and the city that continues to fight back, Homs. A rally has also kicked off across the border in a neighbourhood of the north Lebanon city of Tripoli. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The protesters may not have confidence in the Arab League mission's means to bring about change on Syria. But the mission is clearly emboldening - and energising - a restive populace. Demonstrators are gambling - correctly - that the regime's gunmen won't mow them down with the monitors watching on. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 1.26pm: To add flavour to Martin Chulov's analysis of today's mass demonstrations in Syria, this video below appears to show a thousands strong demo from Hama earlier today. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] . [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 1.36pm: The facebook page of the Local Coordination Committee group in Syria, which helps bring together protests in the country is reporting a number of clashes and incidents where protestors are being shot at and in some instances killed by Syrian security forces in Hama, Idlib, Damascus, and Talkalahk in the province of Homs. The LCC's latest death toll is 17. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 2.13pm: Reuters are also reporting on the violent clashes that have erupted across Syria as hundreds of thousands take to the streets in protest against President Bashar al-Assad's regime. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The London based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claims that 10 activsts have been killed today, lower than the LCC's count of 17. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Reuters also reports that rocks have been thrown at security forces in the Damascus suburb of Douma. In response troops have tear-gassed chanting crowds. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Speaking about the situation in Hama an Observatory spokesperson said, 'Five were martyred today and at least 20 wounded when the Syrian security forces opened fire,' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A further five people are also reported dead in the city of Deraa, 25 wounded in Idlib and at least two dozen injured in the Damascus suburb of Douma. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Speaking to Reuters activist Abu Hisham from Hama said, 'This Friday is different from any other Friday. It is a transformative step. People are eager to reach the monitors and tell them about their suffering.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In the Damascus suburb of Barzeh protesters held up signs saying, 'The Monitors are witnesses who don't see anything,' and shouted, 'Bashar we don't want you, Syrians raise your hands.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 2.42pm: The founder and the director for UK based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, Rami Abdurrahman has told the Guardian that he now has two witness statements reporting that at least one nail bomb was used on crowds protesting in the city of Douma, just north of Damascus at around 11:20 today. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Preceding a visit by Arab League monitors to the city, Abdurrahman said a 70,000 strong demonstration set off to the town hall and the courts of justice whereupon security services fired upon them with tear gas. When this failed to turn protestors back, at least one nail bomb was deployed injuring 24 people. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'Today, I have two witnesses who were attacked today and injured by a nail bomb.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'I think they've [Syrian security services] attacked with one or two [nail bombs] because we have only 24 people injured.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Abdurrahman added that this was not the first time he has been told about the use of nail bombs but until now he has now been able to gather any verifiable witness reports. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'Before when people told me about nail bombs I didn't believe it,' he said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] He added that Arab League monitors were supposed to visit the victims of the attack in hospital imminently. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 3.00pm: The footage purported to be from Homs earlier today appears to show security services in blue military trucks facing off against demonstrators. Shots are also fired as the trucks move towards the crowd. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] . [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 3.38pm: Some disturbing scenes in the video below which is reported to have been filmed in al-Qamishli near the Syrian/Turkish border. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] It appears to show a number of demonstrators being shot by armed persons in the distance. After the wounded are attended to the crowd marches off angrily in the direction of the gun fire. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Due to an editing fault, the video loops again after the 1:46 second mark. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 4.04pm: The LCC is reporting that 150,000 people are conducting a demonstration in front of the Arab League observers in Damascus. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A Washington based LCC spokesperson also tweets that electricity has been cut in a suburb of the capital. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] #Syria: #Damascus Suburbs: #Douma: electricity blackout in the Kabeer mosque where tens of thousands are participating in a sit-in. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] . [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 4.14pm: The very sad story of the fatal shooting of NPR contributor Basil al-Sayed is published here. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] It gives an account of just one of the many citizen journalists who risk their lives to capture footage of protests in Syria and then post the films for the wider world to witness. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In many cases, the videos uploaded to YouTube by citizen journalists have been the only way for the outside world to see the clashes that have cost more than 5,000 people their lives in Syria. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Al-Sayed documented the uprising using a small Samsung camcorder that has a red body. He uploaded hundreds of hours of footage to YouTube. He has a brother and sister, and he was the youngest in his family. He worked at an aluminum plant in Homs. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 4.28pm: Alongside reports of solidarity demonstrations in Lebanon, the country's Daily Star newspaper carries a report about students organising for a blood drive today to help the increasing numbers of those fleeing Syria in need of medical help. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Student activists across Tripoli also set up a handful of tents to host blood drives and gather donations to aid injured Syrian refugees who have regularly crossed into Lebanon in recent weeks to seek medical care. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'We began this campaign after it became clear that the Lebanese government and the institutions that should be concerned with this cause were not doing their job,' said Mohammed Taha, a Lebanese student who was helping set up the makeshift donation centres. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 5.10pm: Further video evidence today of Arab League observers in yellow jackets and white caps appearing to walk with hundreds of demonstrators in the city of Idlib. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] . [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 5.27pm: Media freedom NGO Reporters Without Borders, has called on Arab League monitors to visit jailed Syrian bloggers and journalists. They also provide a list of those they believe to be in prison for their journalistic activities. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In their statement they say: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We call on the Arab League observers to visit them and demand their release, along with the release of all the detainees in Syria. It is also important for the observers to interview those [media activists] who have been freed after months in detention or else this mission will be just a sham. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 5.38pm: As night falls in the Middle East, here's a roundup of today's events. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • In Syria the Arab League monitors' mission has spurred hundreds of thousands of Syrians to take to the streets in one of the biggest day of protests in recent months. At least 10 demonstrators are reported dead and many more injured across the country as violent clashes erupted. Youtube video appears to show security services firing on crowds protesting against President Bashar al-Assad's rule. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The UK based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has claimed that nail bombs have been used against protesters in city of Douma, just north of Damascus, leaving 24 injured. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Protesters have appealed to monitors to take notice of their plight whilst the rebel Free Syrian Army has claimed that it has been unable to make contact with monitors. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Russia has backed the Arab League monitors' mission and described the situation in Syria as 'reassuring'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • In Egypt the US, the UN and Germany all condemned yesterday's army raids on human rights organisations signalling a new low in relations between Egypt's military rulers and the outside world. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Twenty eight Egyptian human rights groups have signed a statement accusing the country's ruling military council of using Hosni Mubarak-era 'repressive tools' in waging an 'unprecedented campaign' against pro-democracy organisations [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 6.00pm: Thank you for all you comments below. We are wrapping up this blog now.

world/middle-east-live/2013/feb/27/syria-crisis-us-support-for-rebels-live,2013-02-27,Syria crisis: US considers more support for rebels - Wednesday 27 February 2013,"4.04pm GMT [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Summary [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Here's a summary of today's events: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syria [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] •US secretary of state John Kerry continues to fuel speculation of a US change in approach to Syria. Speaking ahead of the Friends of Syria meeting in Rome he said: 'We are examining and developing ways to accelerate the transition the Syrian people seek and deserve.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The US is considering making its support for Syrian rebels more explicit by providing body armour, armed vehicles, and military training, the Washington Post reports, citing US and European officials. Elements of the proposed policy, which officials cautioned have not yet been finalised, are being discussed by Kerry in meetings this week as part of a coordinated effort to end the bloody stalemate, it said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The official number of Syrian refugees looks set to exceed one million people within the next few days, the UN’s refugee agency has confirmed. A 105-year-old woman is one of the most recent arrivals at the Za'atari camp in Jordan, the agency said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Rebels claim to have surrounded a key government stronghold in the northern city of Idlib. They claim that if they seize control of a former marble factory converted into a military base, the rest of the city will fall. There were also reports of clashes and an air attack in Aleppo. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Russia has urged the Syrian opposition to demonstrate its commitment to a diplomatic solution by naming its negotiators for a dialogue with the Assad regime. Russia's foreign ministry Twitter feed quoted foreign minister Sergei Lavrov urging the opposition to commit to talks at the Friends of Syria meeting in Rome. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Tunisia [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The ruling Islamist party Ennahda will allow independent figures to take over the most important ministries in the next government, according to its leader. 'We confirm the neutralization of the four departments of sovereignty, including the Interior Ministry, which will not be under political parties,' Rached Ghannouchi said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 3.45pm GMT [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Idlib [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Rebels have surrounded a key government stronghold in the northern city of Idlib, according to a fighter with the jihadi Ahrar al-Sham brigade. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Speaking to the Guardian’s Mona Mahmood, Abu Alyaman said: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We have surrounded the marble factory in Idlib for 15 days now. The regime converted it into a base for the security services because of its strategic position in the city. We call it the ‘factory of death’ because of the endless mortars and shells launched from it. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] At least 1,000 rebels are involved from different brigades, including Ahar al-Sham, Tawheed, al-Haq, Dera al-Jabel and Amjad al-Islam. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] If we liberate the factory, it would herald the beginning of the full liberation of Idlib. The factory is full of military men. We fire mortars against them everyday and block any reinforcements. But the army inside continue to shoot back. We are hoping they will run out of ammunition. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We are using tanks, armoured vehicles, artillery and mortars which we confiscated from the regime. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Once the factory is defeated, we will focus on the international route in Ariha town and then we will be able to declare Idlib liberated. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We believe it is useless to negotiate with a bloody and criminal regime. The regime needs to have an internal dialogue to review all its crimes against the Syrian people. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] It would be too risky to negotiate. The regime would not hesitate to use cars bombs to kill the negotiators. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] They can only be forced from office. They only understand the language of violence. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We have fighters in Damascus who have taken part in the operations including car bombings. They try to protect civilians. If they think there are innocent people around the target, they will cancel the whole operation. Even Jabhat al-Nusra would not set up cars bombs in populated areas. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We try to avoid suicide bombings. We prefer to fight. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 3.13pm GMT [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Oldest Syrian refugee?

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The UNHCR head of communications Melissa Fleming said the woman fled to Jordan's Za'atari camp last night. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] No other details about the woman have been released. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Last night a 105 year old woman fled her #Syria homeland and became a refugee in Jordan.

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In the latest press conference on his nine-day tour of Europe and the Middle East, he said the US hoped to find ways to speed up a political transition in Syria and would discuss ideas at the Friends of Syria meeting later this week. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Speaking alongside his French counterpart, Laurent Fabius, Kerry said: 'We are examining and developing ways to accelerate the transition the Syrian people seek and deserve.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Updated at 2.35pm GMT [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 2.11pm GMT [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Refugees [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The official number of Syrian refugees looks set to exceed one million people in early March, the UN’s refugee agency has confirmed but the actual number fleeing the conflict is “substantially higher”. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Adrian Edwards chief spokesman for the UNHCR told the Guardian that the Syrian exodus is occurring at a faster rate than ever. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Since early January around 40,000 people have fled Syria every week. We are seeing people registering as refugees at a faster rate than has ever happened. That’s partly because we have increased our capacity to register people, but it is partly too because people are fleeing Syria in very large numbers. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The number of officially registered refugees, and those awaiting registration, currently stands at 936,717. Edwards added: 'At the rate we are going, we are going to cross that [million person] thresh hold in March, and probably early March.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] His comments come after Jordan reported a sharp increase in Syrian refugees bringing its total to 418,529 people. Refugees identified in Jordan by the UNHCR stands at the lower figure of 300,341. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Asked to explain the discrepancy, Edwards said: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We know every single individual who has come to us and been registered. They are indicative of the trend, they are not absolute numbers. In all the surrounding countries the governments are reporting higher numbers of refugees. We know that the real number of refugees in the region is substantially higher than the registered figures suggest. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Humanitarian access to internally displaced people in rebel-held areas remains “a substantial problem”, Edwards acknowledged. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] He pointed out that under UN rules humanitarian agencies have to get the consent of host governments to go across borders. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] For the moment we are still in a position of having to negotiate on a case by case basis to get access to where ever we can. We are getting aid to hundreds of thousands of people but the needs in Syria are substantially more than that. It is a big preoccupation of all us in the humanitarian community. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Edwards confirmed that the UNHCR has negotiated with rebel groups to gain humanitarian access. He added that the UN’s office of humanitarian affairs is trying to co-ordinate humanitarian access for a number of aid agencies. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Edwards also revealed the UNHCR has seen only 30% of the money it was expecting to receive following pledges of more than $1.5bn at donor conference in Kuwait last month. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The problem is that the refugees fleeing the country and the need inside the country is escalating at a much faster rate than the money is arriving. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] You’re seeing a 60% increase in the number of refugees arriving just in 2013 alone, meanwhile aid is coming in at a somewhat slower rate. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We requested $496m of this $1.5bn. In our case we about 30% funded. So yes money is coming in, it needs to come in much faster. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] There is this focus on this $1.5bn but remember that is the money simply for the first half of 2013. This is a crisis that seems to be heading well beyond that period, and is continuing to grow with continuing needs. So we will at some point be going back to donors.

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In an interview with Reuters, Hadi al-Amiri, transport minister and head of the formerly armed Badr Organisation, accused Ankara and Doha, which support the opposition to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, of arming jihadi groups in Syria, where many Sunni militants are fighting, including the al-Qaida-approved Jabhat al-Nusra. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] He said: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Presenting money and weapons to al- Qaida (in Syria) by Qatar and Turkey is a declaration of armed action against Iraq. These weapons will reach Iraqi chests for sure ... [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Using militias again is a big mistake. If we (Shias) form militia and they (Sunnis) form militia, then Iraq will be lost.

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A government spokesman for Syrian refugee affairs said that Jordan now hosts 418,529 Syrian refugees. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Anmar Hmoud says 2,490 Syrians crossed into Jordan overnight, with the numbers averaging about 3,000 per night in recent days. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] By the end of March, Jordan could have as many as half a million Syrian refugees. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Some of those coming through unofficial border crossings find shelter in Jordan's Za'atari camp, now home to more than 105,700 refugees. Many more live among Jordanian families. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The camp has seen sporadic violent protests over its harsh desert conditions. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The UN's tally of Syrians officially registered as refugees is edging closer to one million. The total number of registered refugees and individuals awaiting registration stood at 936,717 on 25 February. This includes more than 300,000 in Jordan who are either registered as refugees or in contact with the UN's refugee agency.

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Here's a roundup of the latest developments: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The US is considering making its support for Syrian rebels more explicit by providing body armour, armed vehicles, and military training, the Washington Post reports, citing US and European officials. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] US officials remain opposed to providing weapons to the rebels. Elements of the proposed policy, which officials cautioned have not yet been finalised, are being discussed by secretary of state John Kerry in meetings this week and next with allies in Europe and the Middle East as part of a coordinated effort to end the bloody stalemate. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Kerry confirmed the US was looking to provide more support to rebels. Speaking to students in Germany he said: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In Syria, we want a peaceful resolution. That’s our first choice. But if the president of the country decides he isn’t going to come and negotiate and he’s willing to just kill his people, then you need to at least provide some kind of support for those people who are fighting for their rights and for freedom and for some independence. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Russia has urged the Syrian opposition to demonstrate its commitment to a diplomatic solution by naming its negotiators for a dialogue with the Assad regime. The call came after Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, held talks with his US counterpart in Berlin. Russia's foreign ministry Twitter feed quoted Lavrov urging the opposition to commit to talks at Thursday's Friends of Syria meeting in Rome. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Typhoid has broken out in a rebel-held area of Deir Ezzor due to people drinking contaminated water from the Euphrates river, according to the World Health Organisation. It reported 70 new cases of the disease in Mayadeen and said contaminated water posed a major health risk to many provinces. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Unverified footage from activists purports to show some of the latest clashes in Syria's two main cities. Video shows the view from behind a wall, reportedly in Aleppo, as a tank fires. Burning buildings are also seen near Aleppo. More footage shows shells hitting buildings in the Jobar area of north-east Damascus. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Palestinian territories [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Two teenagers shot and critically injured by Israeli soldiers have become the latest totems in a wave of violent protest across the Palestinian territories. The Israeli army has confirmed that live ammunition was used in Monday's clashes with Palestinian protesters and that two were shot with 0.22 calibre bullets – ammunition known to cause fatalities. Udi Sirkhan, 16, was shot in the head outside an Israeli military outpost near Bethlehem amid clashes after the burial of Arafat Jaradat, whose death in Israeli custody on Saturday sparked the protests. The moments leading up to the shooting of 13-year-old Mohammed Khaled Qurd were captured on film. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Iran [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Satellite images of a suspected nuclear site from which international inspectors have been barred for 18 months, have been published by the Telegraph. It said they showed that Iran has activated the Arak heavy-water production plant. A cloud of steam in one of images indicates heavy-water production, it said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] United Arab Emirates and Bahrain [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Nervous Gulf states appear to be co-ordinating a crackdown on critics in the media and academic world as well as on political activists who challenge the status quo and protest about human rights abuses. Two leading Bahraini journalists were blocked from entering the United Arab Emirates on Monday for unspecified reasons, just days after the UAE refused entry to Kristian Ulrichsen, of the London School of Economics, who was scheduled to speak about Bahrain at a conference on the Arab spring, which has unsettled all the region's conservative monarchies. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Iraq [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Tony Blair has admitted that life in Iraq today is not what he had hoped it would be and the country is still facing 'big problems'. But in an interview for the BBC he defended the war, saying that failing to remove Saddam Hussein would have entailed far worse consequences for the country.

It said it would also respond to 'terrorist groups trying to reinforce their positions by arming themselves and getting reinforcements' as well as neighbouring countries facilitating the smuggling of fighters across borders during that period. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Continued fighting has been reported in Damascus and Aleppo ahead of the proposed start of the ceasefire. Rebel fighters are reported to have made significant gains in Aleppo. Assad's forces have fired tank and rocket barrages at a Damascus suburb killing five people, Reuters reports citing activists. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The UN's refugee agency is to send a delegation to Turkey over mounting concerns that its borders are being unlawfully blocked to Syrian refugees. The Turkish authorities insist that borders are being kept open. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • UN war crimes investigators have asked to meet president Assad to seek access to Syria. Syrian foreign ministry has written to the UN agencies calling on them to 'expose the crimes of the armed terrorist groups, condemn them and hold these groups to account'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Libya [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • There has been renewed gunfire outside the former Gaddafi stronghold of Bani Walid as soldiers fired at residents trying to return to the town after the authorities said it was safe to do so, Chris Stephen reports. The clashes came after the town was reported to have fallen. Human Rights Watch has called for civilians to be protected in the town and for abuses by attacking forces to be prosecuted. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Sudan [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Sudan has warned that it has the right to retaliate after accusing Israel of carrying out an air strike on an arms factory, causing a huge explosion that killed two people. Ahmed Belal Osman, the Sudanese information minister, said that bombs from four aircraft struck a complex and triggered a blast that rocked the capital, Khartoum, before dawn on Wednesday. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 5.32pm BST [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A rebel fighter's account of events in Aleppo [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A Free Syrian Army fighter in Sulaiman al-Halabi district of Aleppo, who gave his name as Abu Yousif, has been describing today's events in the city. He was speaking to our colleague Mona Mahmood via Skype. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] He confirmed that the Kurdish district was taken over by the FSA under a deal with the Kurdish PKK party. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Brigades of the FSA were able to progress from al-Ashrafiyeh district where the Criminal Security branch is. There was also progress in al-Midan and Sulaiman al-Halabi districts. The [government] branch responsible for raids is in al-Midan district. These two branches are the biggest in Aleppo. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Till now the clashes which started at 10am today are continuing and many district have been stormed by the FSA to get towards these two branches. Earlier news claimed that these two branches were taken by the FSA but the truth is the FSA fighters are surrounding these branches and they have still not taken them yet. We are working to get inside them. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In Khan al-Assal district, there is a police school which was under siege by the FSA for 10 days now. The Syrian army were sending reinfocrements every day to ease the siege on it. Today a convoy was heading towards the school and was faced by fire from the FSA and could not get there. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] As for al-Ashrafiyeh district, it was controlled by [the Kurdish] PKK party and the Syrian army. The FSA were in Bani Zaid which is at the entrance to al-Ashrafiyeh. The FSA had to take al-Ashrafiyeh district to be able to reach the Criminal branch – and they did. The advance now is just around the Criminal Security and it is not easy to get control. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] If we talk about Aleppo and the countryside, the FSA are in control of 90% of the ground but when it comes to Aleppo as a city, the FSA are in control of 60% of the ground to 40% for the Syrian army. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] There are spots of power for the Syrian army like the Criminal Security in al-Ashrafiyeh, Political Security in al-Azziziyeh and Air Force security and intelligence in New Aleppo, in addition to the 'raids' branch which is one of the biggest security branches in Aleppo. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] If the FSA can liberate all these branches, we can say at that time that Aleppo has been liberated entirely. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] At the beginning of the attack today, the Syrian army tried to stop the advance but they could not sustain it for long and they pulled out. Some of them left their weapons and ran away, others were killed. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In Khan al-Assal, the FSA fighters were able to take some Syrian army soldiers as prisoners. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] For a long time, al-Ashrafiyeh and Sheikh Maqsoud districts were under the control of the PKK which is in alliance with Assad's regime (it helps in detaining members of FSA and hands them over to the Syrian army). [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] At the beginning we did not plan to open a front from this direction – I mean al-Ashrafiyeh – to avoid any clashes with the PKK. Our target is the regime. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The PKK had agreed not to interfere and not to support any side of the confilct. We did not attack any members of the PKK [today], in fact they pulled out to clear the way for us. It was a deal that they would pull out before the arrival of the FSA. The clashes were with the Syrian army only. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The PKK accepted the deal after a lot of pressure from the Kurdish people. Lately, many buses loaded with Kurdish people from Afreen, 70km northwest of Aleppo, were attacked at random by the Syrian army thinking they are coming from Izzaz. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Since the beginning of the revolution the regime has been trying to keep the PKK on its side but I think now it is going to lose them. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] More than 300 fighters from al-Fattah brigade, Tawheed brigade and Ahrar Syria brigades took part in the operation today. Till now the number of the martyrs in Aleppo is eight, as the regime did not use the planes owing to the cloudy weather. All of them are civilians. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We also found bodies of two soldiers in Khan al-Assal – it seems they tried to defect and were executed by the regime. Yesterday we found seven bodies who were tortured and executed. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] If there is a truce, the FSA will comply and stay in its positions without firing a bullet unless the regime breaks the truce.

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 4.02pm BST [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] UNHCR to lobby Turkey over blocked borders [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The UN's refugee agency is to send a delegation to Turkey over mounting concerns that its borders are being unlawfully blocked to Syrian refugees. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Erika Feller, the UNHCR’s assistant high commissioner for protection is due to visit Ankara to raise the issue of border restrictions. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Turkish authorities insist that borders are being kept open. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The visit comes after Human Rights Watch said that more than 10,000 Syrians are being prevented from claiming asylum in neighbouring countries - mostly Turkey. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Speaking to the Guardian, Adrian Edwards, spokesman for the UNHCR, said: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We are concerned by such reports. We consistently asked governments to keep their borders open to refugees from Syria. We have had assurances from Turkey that borders are still open, but we continue our dialogue with them. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] He confirmed that Feller would be visiting Turkey and may also visit Jordan and Lebanon. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Edwards said the agency does not challenge the facts in the Human Rights Watch report. It estimates that there are between 8,000 to 10,000 Syrians being prevented from crossing into Turkey. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] “We know that there are thousands of people on the Syrian side,” Edwards said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Last week, Gerry Simpson, a senior refugees researcher at Human Rights Watch, claimed Turkey was deliberately blocking its border to put more pressure on the international community to help deal with an exponential rise in the number of Syrian refugees. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] He said: “[Turkey] is sending a message with this border closure to the international community that says: ‘Either you help us look after these increasing numbers, or we will make life more difficult for these people'.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Privately the UNHCR is understood to share concerns that thousands of Syrians are being denied their right to seek asylum in Turkey. But it is concerned to avoid a public row with Ankara while it continues to work with Turkey on help more 100,000 refugees who have been allowed to cross the border. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Edwards also revealed the UNHCR's contingency plans if the Eid ceasefire is observed in Syria. He said: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We are hoping to distribute aid in Syria over this weekend if there is a truce. We are trying to get out aid to around 65,000 people inside Syria. It is a potential window of opportunity that we are hoping to use to get aid to people. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The agency is planning to distribute the aid through the Syrian Arab Red Crescent to Homs, Aleppo and Hassaka. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 3.56pm BST [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Assad receives Eid greetings [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Still no official word from the Syrian government about the Eid al-Ahda ceasefire, but President Assad has begun receiving Eid greetings, the government news agency reports. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] So far, the congratulatory messages seem to be coming mainly from his own government ministers and some local religious figures. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Grand Mufti of the Republic Dr Ahamad Badreddin Hassoun offered congratulations and best wishes to President al-Assad and the Syrian people, praying that Eid al-Adha will herald comfort, blessings and victory.

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The ongoing battle for #Aleppo - MAP According to Sqoor al-Shahba Spokesman #Syria #Assad #Damascus twitter.com/zaidbenjamin/s… [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] — Zaid Benjamin (@zaidbenjamin) October 25, 2012 [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] James Miller, continuing his analysis at EAWorldView, says the key is the government-controlled box at the bottom left of the map. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] There are several military strongholds in that area. Also, while there is fighting reported near the Aleppo International Airport to the southeast, the government still controls the area. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] If the airport falls, Assad loses one of his largest air bases in the entire country - perhaps the one with the most military equipment operating out of it. There's no evidence that this will fall today. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] But that could change. Right now this looks like a planned withdrawal - one which might be a sign of government weakness, but one that is not necessarily a sign of government collapse. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Updated at 3.16pm BST [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 2.41pm BST [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Some analysis on Aleppo [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] James Miller of EAWorldView says rebel advances in Aleppo may be exaggerated but they are nonetheless 'hugely significant': [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The FSA is not likely to take all of Aleppo today, or even any time soon. The Syrian Army also has several extremely large and heavily fortified barracks, particularly in the southern districts, so uncontested FSA control is not on the horizon. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] However, this is a sudden and hugely significant collapse of regime lines. We've been reporting for over a week that the FSA has nearly completely cut regime supply routes to the city. We've also been reporting that over the last month the FSA has captured several key checkpoints, and won several large victories in the countryside of the city. The fact is that the FSA does appear to be grinding away at the regime forces, and those efforts are prevailing. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The main obstacle to the FSA is now, and has always been, lack of logistics. Months ago we predicted that if the FSA proved resourceful enough to weather this obstacle, they would succeed. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] It's also early. It's possible that the regime has made a strategic move here, and will reposition troops insider the city, or outside of it, for strategic gain. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] However, the regime has lost a massive amount of territory in Idlib province, many key bases, huge stockpiles of weapons, and some of its most strategically important highways and supply routes. If the Assad army does not win a quick victory with the troops it has pulled out of these districts in Aleppo, it could be a sign that the military in the northern half of the country is in complete collapse.

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Activists in Aleppo say there are heavy clashes around the city, particularly around a military airport. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A rebel commander Bassam al-Dada told the Associated Press on Thursday that anti-regime fighters have taken two central areas in the country's largest city, including Salaheddin, where battles have raged for months. Al-Dadda is an adviser to rebel leader Riad al-Asaad. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 1.48pm BST [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Landis: 'Game up in Aleppo, it would seem' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Joshua Landis, the main source of the 'Aleppo has fallen' reports, has posted this note on his blog: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Reports from friends inside suggest that Aleppo is falling to rebel troops. Both major Christian areas – al-Syrian al-Jadide and al-Syrian al-Qadime have fallen. The regimes largest Mukhabarat station is in the second area. FSA sharpshooters have gone to the tops of all buildings in these areas with no government opposition. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The major Kurdish neighborhood – Ashrafiya – gave no resistance. The government had been counting on the Kurds to hold back the FSA fighters. Game up in Aleppo it would seem. Regime seems to have cut it loose. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] This is what I am being told by Aleppine friends who are on the phone with relatives inside both these areas. They have sharpshooters on top of their buildings. One said the family’s Filipino maid fainted due to the loud shooting earlier in the day. People are terrified. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] For now (7:00 Eastern S. Time), an eerie silence has settled over the city. Where will the government try to hold the line? [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Obviously all possibility for a ceasefire is off. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Some say the Syrian government is coming back to contest these areas. It is not clear.

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Earlier today, residents told AFP that about 200 rebel fighters had entered the Kurdish Ashrafiyeh district for the first time during the conflict. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Ashrafiyeh is strategically important as it sits on city heights and is a route between the central and northern parts of the country's commercial capital, which has been the theatre of intense fighting between rebels and government troops since mid-July. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syria-watcher Joshua Landis goes further. He is tweeting that the regime has given up the city after rebels also captured Christian areas.

Syrian foreign ministry has written to the UN agencies calling on them to 'expose the crimes of the armed terrorist groups, condemn them and hold these groups to account'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The Syria's government is due to announce whether it plans to observe a four-day ceasfire over Eid al-Adha proposed by the international envoy Lakhdar Brahimi. The Assad government has indicated that it will back the initiative, but rebel leaders said they don't trust the regime to comply. The UN security council urged both sides to back the idea, and added that here was a particular onus on the government 'as the stronger party' to respond positively. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The US has expressed its doubts about the prospects for even a temporary truce. Susan Rice US ambassador to the UN, tweeted: 'Many are duly sceptical about prospects for even a temporary ceasefire, given Assad’s record of broken promises.' Britain's ambassador to the UN, Mark Lyall Grant, noted that the Syrian government had yet to confirm whether it would back the ceasefire a day before it was due to start. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Continued fighting has been reported in Damascus and Aleppo ahead of the proposed start of the ceasefire. Assad's forces have fired tank and rocket barrages at a Damascus suburb killing five people, Reuters reports citing activists said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The US has denied Russian claims that it is supplying Stinger missiles to Syrian rebels. Russia's top military officer, Nikolai Makarov, said Russia's military had learned that rebel forces 'have portable missile launchers of various states, including American-made Stingers.' US Defence secretary Leon Panetta told reporters at the Pentagon that 'I certainly don't know of us providing any such missiles in that area.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Libya [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • There has been renewed gunfire outside the former Gaddafi stronghold of Bani Walid as soldiers fired at residents trying to return to the town after the authorities said it was safe to do so, Chris Stephen reports. The clashes came after the town was reported to have fallen. Human Rights Watch has called for civilians to be protected in the town and for abuses by attacking forces to be prosecuted. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Sudan [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Sudan has warned that it has the right to retaliate after accusing Israel of carrying out an air strike on an arms factory, causing a huge explosion that killed two people. Ahmed Belal Osman, the Sudanese information minister, said that bombs from four aircraft struck a complex and triggered a blast that rocked the capital, Khartoum, before dawn on Wednesday. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 11.57am BST [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Chaos and shooting outside Bani Walid, Libya [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] There has been renewed gunfire outside the former Gaddafi stronghold of Bani Walid as soldiers fired at residents trying to return to the town after the authorities said it was safe to do so, according to the Guardian’s Chris Stephen. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] He witnessed “a scene of chaos” on the outskirts of the town when residents were blocked from returning as pro-Gaddafi fighters continue to resist arrest inside Bani Walid. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The government said last night that everyone could go home [in time for Eid]. The road is packed with people trying to get back to Bani Walid but the army is turning them away. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] While we were there things got very heated. The army started opening fire - the bullets seemed to be going over our heads. People were running, children were screaming. It was pandemonium and I think things are getting worse. Army checkpoints in Tripoli are insisting people [who had fled the violence in Bani Walid] can go home. Now we have thousands and thousands of people backed up along this road, very very angry that they are not being allowed back in. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Pro-Gaddafi fighters continue to put up resistance, according to the authorities, despite declaring an end to the battle for the town, Chris said: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Soldiers outside the town said they are still house clearing and they still fear there are suspected pockets of resistance. The commanders in the town have obviously decided they don’t want anyone back in. They want to tamp the town down. But the trouble is the Libyan government is giving a very different message, and putting out [messages] on television saying [residents of Bani Walid] can go home. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The government has said all along that their target was not the people of Bani Walid, but that the town had become a magnet for all the former Gaddafi regime people elsewhere in Libya, because it was the one area of the country that had no government control. The whole point of the exercise was to hunt these people down. Apparently several dozen have been arrested, including some quite prominent former officials. These people were fighting very hard because they know they face trial and execution if they surrender. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] It feels as if the army has triggered a second conflict by refusing to let people back in. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The clashes caught UN humanitarian aid workers en route to the town by surprise, Chris reported. “They were stunned to hear this is going on,” he said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The people of Bani Walid were already furious at the assault on the town, and the current confusion over whether they can return will only add to the tension, Chris said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The fight for Bani Walid has been a “huge set back for the Libyan authorities”, he added. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The operation against Bani Walid was supposed to be the new parliament showing that it could be sensible and that it could run the country. They wanted to say that everyone can go home and now they are stopping people going home. This is going to antagonise everyone and its going to cause a fresh new cycle of violence. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Updated at 12.02pm BST [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 11.18am BST [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syria calls on UN to 'expose terrorist groups' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In what appears to be a pre-emptive strike against the UN war crimes investigation (see earlier post), the Syrian foreign ministry has written to the UN security council, the UN general secretariat and the UN Human Rights Council, calling on them to 'expose the crimes of the armed terrorist groups, condemn them and hold these groups to account'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The government news agency, Sana, says: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syria's demand came in identical letters sent by the Foreign and Expatriates Ministry to the Head of UNSC, UNSG, UNHRC Chairperson and High Commissioner for Human Rights in which it said it wanted to share confirmed information on the violence Syria is being subjected to at the hands of the armed terrorist groups and the horrible violations by these groups of the international law and the international human rights law. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The ministry stressed in its letters that the armed terrorist groups and their supporters are continuing the shedding of the Syrian blood in contradiction with all human values and at a by now known timing ahead of sessions held by the UNSC to discuss the situation in Syria. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 11.04am BST [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] China backs Syria ceasefire [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] China has called on all sides in the Syrian conflict to observe the proposed ceasefire, Reuters reports. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'We are happy with the positive reaction to the proposal from relevant sides in Syria,' foreign ministry spokesman Hong Leihe told a daily news briefing today. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'We hope that all the relevant parties in Syria can take a sincere attitude and concrete action to support and cooperate with UN envoy Brahimi's proposal and his mediation efforts and seize the opportunity to earnestly implement promises to cease fire and stop the violence.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] China also hoped this would be a chance 'to put in place a long-term and effective ceasefire to create conditions to relieve the Syrian people's hardship and start political dialogue and the political transition process as soon as possible,' he said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 10.57am BST [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Assad regime plans to spend more next year [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Syrian government plans to increase its spending next year despite falling revenues, the Lebanese Daily Star reports, citing the government news agency. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Finance minister Mohammad Juleilati said spending on salaries was projected to rise 13% to 236bn Syrian pounds ($3.47bn). [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Subsidies on food, fuel and power, and for agriculture, will increase 25% to 512bn pounds in a budget 4% larger than this year's at 1.38 trillion. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In remarks carried by the state news agency, the minister said state revenue was expected to fall because of 'the world war being launched on us and the sanctions which aim to create imbalances in the Syrian economy' ... [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Juleilati did not say how large the revenue shortfalls would be or give a figure for Syria's projected budget deficit. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 10.40am BST [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] UN war crime investigators seek access to Syria [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] UN war crimes investigators have asked to meet president Assad to seek access to Syria, Reuters reports. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The team, led by Brazilian expert Paulo Pinheiro, has been gathering evidence and testimony on atrocities committed by Syrian government forces and armed rebels in the 19-month-old conflict. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'We decided to send a letter to President al-Assad calling for a meeting ... it would be very important that he could receive us,' Pinheiro told reporters in Geneva. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'We intend to go there without conditions to meet President Assad to discuss access of our commission to Syria,' added Pinheiro, who went to Damascus in June in his personal capacity for talks with senior Syrian officials. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Carla del Ponte, a former UN war crimes prosecutor who has joined the inquiry, was asked about similarities with past investigations including those into war crimes in former Yugoslavia. 'The similarity is of course we are handling the same crimes, crimes against humanity and war crimes for sure.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] She added: 'My main task will be to continue the inquiry in the direction of determining the senior political and military authorities responsible for these crimes.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The investigators have drawn up a secret list of Syrian individuals and units suspected of committing crimes including murder and torture, which they say could pave the way for future criminal prosecution. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 10.24am BST [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Spreading the conflict to Lebanon? [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Wissam al-Hassan, the intelligence chief of Lebanon’s internal security forces who was assassinated in Beirut last week, offered a grim view of the Syria conflict during a visit to the US in August, the Washington Post reports. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Dictator Bashar al-Assad, he told us, still had a chance to outlast the rebellion against him, though “it will take a couple of years and more than 100,000 killed.” For the Assad regime, he added, “one of the solutions of the Syrian conflict is to move it outside Syria. He survives by making it a regional conflict.” [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Hassan's death in a bomb attack last Friday was seen by many as confirming his prediction about the conflict spreading. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Lord Michael Williams, who was UN Special Coordinator for Lebanon 2008-11, warned yesterday: 'The danger is rising that Lebanon is gradually being drawn into the Syrian imbroglio.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] If that was the intention behind the bomb attack, though, it has not succeeded so far – and Paul Salem, in an article on the Carnegie Endowment's website, argues that Lebanon's fragile peace will probably hold. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The capital and most parts of the country have returned to normal, with the expectation that despite the dramatic events of the past few days, the political system will absorb yet another shock and return, once more, to the precarious calm that has generally prevailed in recent years. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Hassan’s assassination is part of a long-simmering conflict between the Syrian regime and its foes that has been going on for many years. The conflict is between two broad axes: one side includes Syria, Iran, and Hezbollah, and the other is aligned with Saudi Arabia and the west. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The pro-Assad axis indeed scored a blow with Friday’s assassination. But direct retribution is unlikely. The battle for and against the Assad regime’s survival is being fought in Syria, not Lebanon. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] There has been much speculation that Hassan was killed for arresting former Lebanese information minister Michel Samaha – an Assad ally – who has been accused of plotting terrorism in Lebanon. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Elias Muhanna of the Qifa Nabki blog speculates that Samaha might have been the victim of a sting operation set up by Hassan.

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] It quoted Martin Nesirky, spokesman for UN secretary general, as saying: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] You will have seen his [Brahimi’s] comments in Cairo earlier today [Wednesday] in which he said he expected an announcement by the Syrian Government regarding his proposed pause in fighting. He said that many in the opposition have also responded positively.

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] It is worth republishing here with the key passages marked in italics: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The members of the Security Council welcomed the important and timely initiative of the Joint Special Representative of the United Nations and the League of Arab States, Lakhdar Brahimi, for a ceasefire and a cessation of violence in all its forms during the period of Eid Al Adha, and echoed the joint appeal of the Secretaries-General of the United Nations and the League of Arab States to all regional and international actors to support it. The Members of the Security Council called upon all regional and international actors to use their influence on the parties concerned to facilitate the implementation of the ceasefire and cessation of violence. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The members of the Security Council called upon all parties, in particular on the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic as the stronger party, to respond positively to the initiative of the Joint Special Representative, and reiterated their call of the Syrian authorities to allow immediate, full and unimpeded access of humanitarian personnel to all populations in need of assistance, in accordance to international law and guiding principles of humanitarian assistance and called upon all parties in Syria, in particular the Syrian authorities, to cooperate fully with the United Nations and relevant humanitarian organizations to facilitate the provision of humanitarian assistance. In this context, the members of the Security Council called upon all member states to contribute urgently to the United Nations Syrian Humanitarian Assistance Response Plan. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The members of the Council agreed that an Eid Al Adha cease-fire could be a first step towards a sustainable cessation of all violence, in conformity with Security Council resolutions 2042 (2012) and 2043 (2012) and underscored the need to launch an inclusive Syrian-led political transition leading to a democratic, plural, political system that realizes the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people for democracy, equality and justice, regardless of their affiliation, ethnicities or beliefs.

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The fighting in Harasta, just northeast of Damascus, erupted after rebels overran two army roadblocks on the edge of the large town, which is on the main highway linking the capital to the country's north, they said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'Harasta is being pummelled by tanks and rocket launchers deployed in the highway. The rebels are putting up a fight and it does not seem the army will be able to enter the town this time,' Mohammad, a Damascus resident, said by phone. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] He was referring to the last armoured incursion by loyalist forces into Harasta a month ago, which opposition campaigners said had killed 70 people. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Harasta Media Office opposition activists' group described the town as a 'disaster zone' following the shelling. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Syria Observatory for Human Rights Human Rights said six soldiers were killed in clashes in an around Damascus.

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] President Assad said all but 'terrorists' would be released under the amnesty. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] But the coalition, which includes Human Rights Watch and Reporters Without Borders point out that a number of high profile journalists and rights campaigners remain detained incommunicado, including Mazen Darwish president of the Syrian Centre for Media and Freedom of Expression, and a number of his staff. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director of Human Rights Watch, said: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] If President Assad is serious about his amnesty, he should open the doors of all his prisons to independent monitors to check who is actually detained and why. Otherwise, this amnesty will be yet another false promise, with released detainees soon replaced by other activists, humanitarians, and journalists locked up for peacefully doing their jobs. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 8.37am BST [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Summary [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Welcome to Middle East Live. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Assad government is due to announce whether it will observe a ceasefire over Eid al-Adha, amid widespread doubts about the initiative. Here's a roundup of the latest developments: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syria [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Opposition activists expressed scepticism about the prospects for an unmonitored ceasefire over the Eid holiday beginning tomorrow, warning that the Assad regime was simply playing for time by indicating support for the truce. Abdelbaset Sieda, head of the opposition Syrian National Council, said: 'This regime, we don't trust it, because it is saying something and doing something else on the ground.' The Syrian government is due to consult with its generals over the plan. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Rebel commanders have challenged international envoy Lakhdar Brahimi's claim that most rebel groups have agreed to the ceasefire, the LA Times reports. Colonel Qassim Saadeddine, commander of Free Syrian Army forces in Homs, said: 'We will observe it as long as the regime does. Ee don't expect them to observe it for even one minute.' Abu Firas, a spokesman for the opposition Revolutionary Council for Aleppo and Its Suburbs, said the Free Syrian Army had agreed to a cease-fire only on the conditions that the government release all detainees, withdraw its army from the city and end its siege of Homs — conditions that are highly unlikely to be met. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The US has expressed its doubts about the prospects for even a temporary truce. Susan Rice US ambassador to the UN, tweeted: 'Many are duly sceptical about prospects for even a temporary ceasefire, given Assad’s record of broken promises.' Britain's ambassador to the UN, Mark Lyall Grant, noted that the Syrian government had yet to confirm whether it would back the ceasefire a day before it was due to start. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The US has denied Russian claims that it is supplying Stinger missiles to Syrian rebels. Russia's top military officer, Nikolai Makarov, said Russia's military had learned that rebel forces 'have portable missile launchers of various states, including American-made Stingers.' US Defence secretary Leon Panetta told reporters at the Pentagon that 'I certainly don't know of us providing any such missiles in that area.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • There are signs everywhere of a retreating opposition in Bab al-Sebaa Street in Homs, according to the New York Times, in a rare report from the city, but it says the government's usual tactics of blunt bombardment won't work in the area. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Syrian government has grown frustrated with its inability to crush the opposition forces, so it has adopted an unforgiving strategy of using tanks, artillery and aircraft to bomb and blast them into submission. That has worked in smaller places, like the village of Maarat al-Noaman, obliterated last week just after the opposition declared it “liberated.” [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] But it cannot work here: the city is too large, too built up, so the government’s soldiers are forced to fight on the ground, and find their way through these kinds of spaces. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Libya [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Libyan government forces have captured the town of Bani Walid, ending an eight-day battle that has cost at least 20 lives and left more than 200 wounded. The desert town, described by the government as Libya's last stronghold loyal to Muammar Gaddafi, has defied official control since January. Human Rights Watch has called for civilians to be protected in the town and for abuses by attacking forces to be prosecuted. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Sudan [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Sudan has warned that it has the right to retaliate after accusing Israel of carrying out an air strike on an arms factory, causing a huge explosion that killed two people. Ahmed Belal Osman, the Sudanese information minister, said that bombs from four aircraft struck a complex and triggered a blast that rocked the capital, Khartoum, before dawn on Wednesday.

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In the bleak, windswept landscape of the rapidly swelling Za'atari camp and the overcrowded towns and villages of northern Jordan, child refugees from Syria are struggling to cope with the weight of their experiences during 18 months of bloodshed.

We have seen a lot of psycho-social distress, behavioural problems,' says Nadine Haddad of Save the Children, which is launching a campaign to draw attention to the plight of children caught up in the conflict. Adolescent boys tend towards aggression and even vandalism; younger children suffer nightmares and bed-wetting. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] According to Michele Servadei of Unicef, the number of unaccompanied children arriving at Za'atari has increased to more than 20 a week. Some are completely alone; some have been sent by their parents to travel with neighbours or extended family members. 'Most are boys between 14 and 18, but we are also now getting some girls – a symptom that things are getting worse, more families are being disrupted.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] These children are part of a bigger picture. The UN says a total of more than 280,000 Syrian citizen have registered as refugees or are awaiting registration after fleeing to Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq. But there are tens, maybe hundreds, of thousands more outside the camps and formal process of registration. Aid agencies, host countries and small communities are struggling to cope with the influx. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Ohood, a 14-year-old from east Deraa, made the journey to Jordan a month ago with her parents and seven of her siblings. The Free Syrian Army escorted the group to a point close to the Syrian border. 'We had to walk in the dark for three hours, very slowly and quietly,' she says while washing clothes in a bucket by a standpipe. 'It was hard for the little children.' They arrived in Jordan at 2am. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Her family left after repeated shelling of their neighbourhood. 'One day we were at school, about 50 children in an Arabic lesson, sitting at our desks. There were clashes with the FSA, and they got mad and started shooting.' Asked who 'they' were, she says: '[President] Bashar's security. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'It was very frightening. All the children started running away, trying to escape. The shooting lasted about an hour.' A few days later the family fled to Jordan. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Kareem, a 14-year-old with a cherubic face, mimics the sound of shells and gunfire while describing attacks on his and his neighbours' homes. 'I could hear the rockets passing our house. Next door to us a woman was hit by shrapnel in her chest while nursing her baby. Three children also died. We stayed in the bedroom of our house, about 30 or more of us. The bombing went on all night.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] He pulls up the leg of his jeans to show burn scars on his leg. 'There were fires in the street, they were burning petroleum. I was running because I thought a tank was coming. I fell into a fire.' Kareem was taken to a field hospital for basic treatment, but a year on his leg still causes pain. Despite his ready smile, he anxiously pulls at his lower lip while describing what happened. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Making constant gunfire noises, Kareem follows us through the rows of flapping tents to find Mohamed. An engaging 11-year-old writer of poetry, he arrived at Za'atari camp around a month ago, shortly before his mother gave birth to Mohamed's new brother. The baby, he says, is 'skinny and doesn't nurse. We're all sick from the dust, we can't breathe normally.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Shortly before they left their home in Deraa province, a bullet whizzed in through a window and smashed through a cake his mother had made to break the Ramadan fast. Mohamed and his siblings usually hid in a cupboard when the shooting started. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] One of Mohamed's poems is a tribute to a man called Nathem, 'the first person to die in our town. He was on a protest, throwing rocks, and the soldiers started shooting.' Another poem is, he says, about freedom. He recites the opening lines: 'Homs is on fire, and all of Syria went to its aid.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Omar's story: 'I was sleeping when the shell fell' – video [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Bisan's story: 'It was a massacre' – video [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Emmad's story: 'The mountain route was risky' – video [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] It is hard to keep track of children in Za'atari despite the best efforts of aid agencies. Plans to use colour-coding and symbols to identify different parts of the camps have yet to be implemented; and in any case the relentless sand and dust swiftly turn everything a uniform brown. Younger children frequently get lost; older ones sometimes sneak out past the camp's fences and armed guards, or simply disappear within the massive compound. We spend an hour fruitlessly searching for Moussa, a 15-year-old who lives alone in the camp, one of more than 200 unaccompanied minors registered since Za'atari opened on 29 July. His mother and two brothers are also in Jordan but, as Syrians, they are not permitted to pay 'bail' money to get Moussa out of the camp so he can join them. Moussa told Save the Children that he had fought with the FSA, and was imprisoned for 22 days after being captured by the Syrian military. 'I was tortured and I saw children dying. I've got scars on my feet, chest and back. There were hundreds of us in prison. I was in a big cell with other children. The youngest ones were nine or 10, they had been captured during protests. I was beaten up every day, and they used electricity too.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] His interrogators wanted information about the FSA, he said. 'But I never told them.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] He said there were dead bodies in his cell. 'They'd been there a long time, and they stank. They were decomposing, there were maggots.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A young man in the tent in which Moussa had been sleeping tells us the boy has gone to the 'new camp', a vast area of expansion where tents are being erected in anticipation of thousands of arrivals over the coming weeks. Delivery trucks and bulldozers constantly churn up the sand into choking clouds, which are then fanned by the relentless wind. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The tents are mostly bare, with foam mattresses laid on groundsheets. Most families left their homes with minimal possessions; many of the children have only the clothes they are wearing. The temperature is already dropping after dark; soon it will be bitterly cold at night. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Aid workers say the camp inmates feel humiliated by their new living conditions. 'Their passports are confiscated, they are forced to eat whatever they're given, they wash their clothes in a bucket, they have nothing to do all day. There is a lack of dignity. It's like being in prison,' said one. Some refugees are even asking to return to Syria. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Save the Children, Unicef and other agencies have established 'child friendly spaces' where children can play and take part in therapeutic activities, such as drawing and painting. 'They express their feelings and what they've seen in different ways,' says Haddad of Save the Children. 'Some draw happy families. Some draw Syria. Some focus on horrific things. Each child has his or her way.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Jordan's burgeoning refugee crisis does not end at the camp's perimeter fence. In addition to the 31,000 people in Za'atari camp, there are an estimated 140,000 Syrian refugees living in towns and villages in northern Jordan. Many extended families stretch across both sides of the border, and some refugees are crowding in with relatives. Others are renting apartments in cities such as Ramthe, Mafraq and Irbid. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Hassan, a 14-year-old from Zaynab, near Damascus, and a further eight members of his family have squashed into a relative's house in Mafraq a few weeks after fleeing Syria in the aftermath of what he describes as 'a massacre in our town'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] According to his account, Syrian helicopters fired rockets at a night-time funeral for an FSA fighter. 'There were about 5,000 people. I was at the edge of the funeral.' The mourners were making a lot of noise, he says, but when the rockets hit, 'there was no sound'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'There were bodies, and pieces of bodies, everywhere. Everyone was looking for relatives. Everyone was scared because there were helicopters still in the sky. I saw heads 20 metres away from the blast. I saw arms and legs that had been cut from bodies. There was lots of blood everywhere. Before I go to sleep at night, I always remember what happened that day.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Hassan's uncle and cousin were among the dead. 'We found their bodies in the mosque.' He adds: 'Everybody from young to old hates Bashar.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] He has not been able to start school in Jordan, although he is trying to register. Local schools are struggling with the refugee influx, and aid agencies are trying to help with prefabricated classrooms and textbooks. They are also encouraging teachers among the refugee population to volunteer to work. In Za'atari camp alone, there are up to 10,000 school-age children – the equivalent of 10 average-sized secondary schools in the UK. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'Many children have lost months or even years of schooling,' says Servadei of Unicef. School is not only essential from an educational point of view but also to provide children with a sense of routine and occupation. Boredom is one of the biggest problems for refugee children. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Seventeen-year-old Mohammed, now living with a relative in Irbid, would also like to restart his education. 'I want to register but they have told me the schools are full. It's boring. I just go for walks around the town.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Before leaving Syria, Mohammed was involved in the FSA. 'We used to help them, but I was not fighting myself. We would scout roads and refill ammo. There were younger children than me going out with the FSA, as young as 10.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Youngsters, he says, were involved in the uprising from the beginning. A protest in his home town of Deraa, initiated by schoolchildren, led to the arrest of about 50. 'They were taken to jail. They had their fingernails pulled out, they were beaten with sticks. Some lost their minds.' Some of the children were as young as six, he says. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'A lot of children have been killed. My friends, my cousins.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Mohammed intends to go back to Syria to join the fight, but first needs treatment for burns on his face and body, which have left him extensive scarring and pain. 'I was standing next to a car, which was hit. There was a big fire. I was burned all over. It was like a dream. Then I passed out.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] He crossed to Jordan alone around six weeks ago, going first to Za'atari camp and now staying with a relative in Irbid. His family is still in Deraa. 'I miss them. I can't stay here while my family might be killed. I want to go back. I'm no longer afraid of anything.'

world/middle-east-live/2013/jan/30/syria-crisis-un-appeal-after-aleppo-massacre-live,2013-01-30,Syria crisis: opposition leader offers talks with Assad regime - Wednesday 30 January 2013,"3.53pm GMT [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Summary [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Here's a summary of the main events today. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syria [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Syria's main opposition leader Moaz al-Khatib has offered to hold talks with the Assad regime if the government releases political prisoners. In a statement on his Facebook page Khatib, who is head of the Syrian National Coalition, said: 'I am prepared to sit down directly with representatives of the Syrian regime in Cairo, Tunis or Istanbul.' The Syrian National Council, the largest group in the coalition, rejected the move saying it was against negotiating with a criminal regime. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The UN has exceeded its record fundraising target of $1.5bn to help Syrians caught in the civil war. Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the UAE each pledged $300m. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Israeli warplanes have attacked a target on the Syrian-Lebanese border, according to unconfirmed reports, after several days of heightened warnings from government officials over Syria's stockpiles of chemical weapons. The Reuters news agency cited a western diplomat and a security source as saying there had been 'a hit' in the border area. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said it had no comment on the report. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Three pro-Assad Syrian gunmen were arrested after clashing with police in southern Turkey, after an apparent plot to kidnap a Syrian opposition lawyer. A fourth Syrian managed to escape from police, and ran towards the Syrian border while randomly shooting in a forest, a source at the office of Hatay governor told the Guardian. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The international envoy to Syria, Lakhdar Brahimi, warned that Syria was being destroyed and urged the security council to settle its differences over the crisis and get behind a plan for a political transition. Speaking to reporters after briefing the council, he said: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syria is being destroyed bit by bit. And in destroying Syria, the region is being pushed into a situation that is extremely bad and extremely important for the entire world. That is why I believe the security council simply cannot continue to say, 'We are disagreement, therefore, let’s wait for better times.' I think they have got to grapple with this problem now. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Egypt [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • President Mohamed Morsi has insisted that the controversial state of emergency that he ordered on Sunday is temporary, as the terms of the curfew were eased in Ismailiya. Speaking after meeting with German chancellor Angela Merkel, Morsi said: 'As soon as the situation stabilises the measures will be revoked.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Two more men have been shot dead in Cairo, raising the death toll to at least 54 in a week of clashes. The men, named as Ahmed Saad Eldin and Reda El-Refai, were hit by gunshots before dawn on the edge of Tahrir Square. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Updated at 4.22pm GMT [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 3.36pm GMT [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Khatib's offer of talks [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Reuters has more on Khatib's offer of talks: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'I am prepared to sit down directly with representatives of the Syrian regime in Cairo, Tunis or Istanbul,' Khatib said in a statement on his Facebook page. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] He set out two conditions of his own: the release of what he said was 160,000 detainees held in Syrian prisons and intelligence facilities, and instructions to Syrian embassies to issue new passports to Syrians whose documents had expired. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Underlining the continued rifts amongst Assad's foes, the opposition Syrian National Council - some of whose members are represented on Alkhatib's council - immediately distanced itself from his comments. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'The Syrian people are paying a high price to obtain their right to full freedom ... The Syrian National Council affirms its absolute commitment to the Syrian people's will, and rejects any settlement with the Syrian regime or negotiation with it.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] More analysts have expressed doubt about Khatib's move. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Tony Badran, research fellow at the US thinktank the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, tweeted: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Some think Khatib's move is 'masterful,' will frazzle Assad. Assad is likely to view it as one of desperation & a confirmation of his line. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] — Tony Badran (@AcrossTheBay) January 30, 2013 [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Assad's propaganda: US has abandoned u. Doesn't want regime change. U can't win. No choice but to talk to me. To him, Khatib confirms it. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] — Tony Badran (@AcrossTheBay) January 30, 2013 [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Commentator Michael Weiss tweets this prediction: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Bet you anything that by nightfall or sooner Khatib FB comment re dialogue is walked back. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] — michaeldweiss (@michaeldweiss) January 30, 2013 [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Emile Hokayem, Mideast analyst at International Institute for Strategic Studies, thinks Khatib is taking a big risk. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Khatib's move is like holding a gun to one's head (hoping the chamber is empty) and hoping the other will somehow hold the gun as well after [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] — Emile Hokayem(@emile_hokayem) January 30, 2013 [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Yes, Khatib showed courage but he took an enormous risk for his coalition. If Assad snubs or humiliates or outmaneuvers him, he is toast. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] — Emile Hokayem(@emile_hokayem) January 30, 2013 [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In Khatib's defense, not only Western support didn't materialize (expected) but Gulf appetite for the fight dropped. Weaponry and money down [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] — Emile Hokayem(@emile_hokayem) January 30, 2013 [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] biggest problem for Khatib is language he used to call for conditional talks. Sounds like desperation. Makes him look weak to Assad + rebels [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] — Emile Hokayem(@emile_hokayem) January 30, 2013 [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 3.22pm GMT [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Egypt's curfew [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Mohamed Morsi has insisted that the controversial state of emergency that he ordered on Sunday is temporary, as the terms of the curfew were eased in Ismailiya. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] AP reports: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Speaking after meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Morsi said, 'as soon as the situation stabilizes the measures will be revoked.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Reuters adds: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The nightly curfew in Ismailiya, one of three Egyptian cities where a state of emergency was declared this week, has been cut to three hours from the nine hours originally imposed, the governor said on Wednesday. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Governor Gamal Imbaby, a former general, told reporters the new times for the curfew, which has been routinely defied since it came into effect on Monday, would be 2 am to 5am instead of 9 pm to 6 am. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The governors of Suez and Port Said, the other two cities along the Suez Canal where a curfew was imposed, said they were still discussing the matter. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Updated at 3.23pm GMT [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 3.09pm GMT [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] UN exceeds fundraising target [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The UN has exceeded its record fund raising target of $1.5bn at the donor conference in Kuwait, Ban Ki-moon told the meeting. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Kuwait News Agency quotes him saying: 'We have exceeded our target of $1.5bn'. The bulk of the pledges came from Gulf countries. Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the UAE each pledged $300m. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Adrian Edwards, spokesman for the UNHCR, tweeted: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Big hats off to Govts who today pledged help for #Syria's displaced, #refugees. $1.5bn in help #SyriaResponse. Guterres: 'Unprecedented' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] — Adrian Edwards (@AdrianEdwrds) January 30, 2013 [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Oxfam's deputy humanitarian director, Nigel Timmins welcomed the pledges. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In a statement he said: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The world has stepped forward and says it will help the Syrian people. This is good news. Donors now need to ensure that their pledges quickly become real aid – shelter, food, medicine, clean water and education for children – to meet the needs of families that have suffered so much. There should be no delay - people need support now. We would also encourage donors to prepare for the long-haul. The UN appeal covers just six months and it is likely that people will continue to need support for some time to come. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] People from Syria are facing a colossal crisis and it is growing worse every day. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Updated at 3.14pm GMT [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 2.55pm GMT [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Reaction to Khatib's offer [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Khatib's offer of talks with the Assad regime has gone well with commentators and analysts ...

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Ahmed Moaz al-Khatib, leader of the Syrian National Coalition, said he was prepared to negotiate not for the regime's survival but for its departure, according to a statement [in Arabic] on his website. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] AFP translates Khatib's statement as: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] I announce I am ready for direct discussions with representatives of the Syrian regime in Cairo, Tunis or Istanbul [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] I became aware thanks to the media that the regime in Syria has called on the opposition to enter into dialogue. [NEW PARAGRAPH] While it is not right for anyone to bargain with the freedom for which our people have paid so dearly in blood, I say there are basic conditions before I sit down with representatives of the regime. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The move is seen as a bold one that risks splitting the opposition. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Salman Shaikh, director of the Brookings Doha Centre, tweeted: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Khattib's offer of dialogue with the regime will split the #NC. After Kuwait (where funds pledged not to #NC), wonder where NC headed?#Syria [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] — Salman Shaikh (@Salman_Shaikh1) January 30, 2013 [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Indeed the Syrian National Council, which is part of Khatib's coalition, has rejected his offer. It said it is categorically opposed to negotiating with a 'criminal regime'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Updated at 2.35pm GMT [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 2.03pm GMT [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Israeli 'air strike' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Harriet Sherwood in Jerusalem has more on the unconfirmed reports of an Israeli air strike on the Syrian-Lebanese border. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Reuters news agency cited a western diplomat and a security source saying there had been 'a hit' in the border area. The Israeli Defence Forces said it had no comment on the report. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The report followed claims in the Lebanese media that up to eight IDF fighter planes had flown over Lebanon's airspace on Tuesday afternoon until the early hours of Wednesday morning. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Israel has warned it would take military action to prevent the Syrian regime's chemical weapons falling into the hands of Hezbollah in Lebanon, or what it terms 'global jihadists' fighting inside Syria. Israeli military intelligence is said to be monitoring the area around the clock by satellite for possible convoys carrying weapons. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Hezbollah is also believed to have extensive stockpiles of conventional weapons inside Syria. Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, 'wants to remove everything from Syrian soil to Lebanon', said Amnon Sofrin, a former head of intelligence for the Mossad. Israel, he added, is 'looking very carefully at convoys heading from Syria to Lebanon'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Updated at 2.11pm GMT [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 1.41pm GMT [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Failed kidnapping in Turkey [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Three pro-Assad Syrian gunmen were arrested after clashing with police in southern Turkey, after an apparent plot to kidnap a Syrian opposition lawyer, writes Figen Gunes. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A fourth Syrian managed to escape from police and run towards the Syrian border while randomly shooting in a forest, a source at the office of Hatay governor told the Guardian. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Five Turkish citizens were also arrested because of their connection in the kidnap operation, the source added. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The believed target was 38-year-old lawyer Musa Erman, who is based in Antakya and has represented Syria opposition figures. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] He was forced into a vehicle nearby his home yesterday while his hands were tied. The gunmen took him to Yayladagi border crossing in an attempt smuggle him back into Syria. They tried to hide in a forest, according to Turkish media reports, but were tracked down by Turkish police who ordered them to surrender. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The group responded with a gunfire. Two of the gunmen were injured and taken to Antakya State Hospital. The lawyer was unharmed, according to Today's Zaman. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Hatay governor Mehmet Celalettin Lekesiz said an investigation had been launched. One Russian grenade along with 9mm handgun and high number of empty shell cases were recovered by security officials. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Turkey’s state-run Anatolia news agency said the lawyer is one of the “important names” of the opposition. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Updated at 2.24pm GMT [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 12.29pm GMT [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Humanitarian appeal [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The UN is confident it will raise its record appeal of $1.5bn for Syrian refugees after securing $1.2bn in pledges so far at donor conference in Kuwait. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Speaking from the conference, Melissa Fleming, chief spokeswoman for the UNHCR, told the Guardian: “If we don’t reach it by the end of the day, we are hopeful that we will reach it very soon.” [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] But she stressed that the $1.5bn requested by the UN was the minimum required to deal with the scale of the emergency. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We are hugely encouraged. We have yet to see the money that has been pledged and we will have to see how it will be channelled. However it was very clear that the countries understood devastating the humanitarian situation is. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] At this stage is unclear how the money will reach the UN, she said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We believe a significant amount will come to UNHCR. But we also know that a good portion of the money will go to the refugee hosting governments in the region, such as Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and Iraq and their NGOs, who have so generously come forward to help refugees who are pouring over the border [at the rate of] 3,000 a day. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] How the money will be allocated has yet to be decided, she said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] There are reports that China has pledged $1m to the conference. Fleming said this has yet to be confirmed. But she added: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We did hear that China was coming forward with a donation. What we are saying is that we welcome new donors. One of the reasons for this conference was to expand that donor base.

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The men, named as Ahmed Saad Eldin and Reda El-Refai, were hit by gunshots before dawn on the edge of Tahrir Square, the source said, adding it was not clear who fired the shots. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Police have been firing volleys of teargas against protesters throwing stones in streets around the square.

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Reuters reports: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A Lebanese army statement said that four Israeli planes entered Lebanese air space at 4.30 pm (1430GMT) on Tuesday. They were replaced four hours later by another group of planes which overflew southern Lebanon until 2am and a third mission took over, finally leaving at 7.55am on Wednesday morning. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Lebanon frequently complains that Israeli jets overfly its territory. However the recent activity was much more concentrated than usual. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] There was no explanation for the operations in the region, bordering southern Syria. The statement made no mention of planes entering Syrian airspace. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Israel's vice premier Silvan Shalom said on Sunday that any sign that Syria's grip on its chemical weapons is slipping, as President Bashar al-Assad fights rebels trying to overthrow him, could trigger Israeli military strikes.

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The emergency powers give the police the authority to detain people in Port Said, Ismailiya and Suez for up to 30 days without any judicial review, and permit trials of those detained before emergency security courts. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Shura Council, Egypt’s partially elected upper house, has also passed a law to give the military the right arrest and try civilians. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Morsi should order an end to military trials of civilians and instruct Egyptian military commanders to bring all civilians they arrest before civilian courts, Human Rights Watch said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, said: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The government has the duty to take reasonable steps to protect security, but this knee-jerk response granting the police excessive powers is certainly not the answer. What is glaringly missing are orders to the police and military to exercise restraint in their use of force and to warn that all official abuses will be punished.

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Sana usually blames 'terrorists' for such killings, but has begun to single out Jabhat al-Nusra more recently. The group, which is linked to al-Qaida was proscribed last year by the US as a terrorist organisation. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Sana said Syrian troops clashed with terrorists in the Bustan al-Qasr area, where the bodies were discovered. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Witnesses in the area blamed Assad supporters for the killings. The Telegraph's Ruth Sherlock, who is Aleppo, reported: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] It was impossible to be certain who was responsible for their deaths. But those identified, at least half the total by nightfall, were from rebel-held districts, and locals blamed government checkpoints on the other side of the river. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The opposition Syrian National Coalition expressed its shock at what it claimed were field executions by Assad's forces. It urged the UN's security council to refer Syria to the international criminal court. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Updated at 9.14am GMT [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 8.39am GMT [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Summary [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Welcome to Middle East Live. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Here's a roundup of the latest developments and analysis. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syria [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon has appealed to all combatants in Syria's civil war to stop fighting 'in the name of humanity'. Speaking at an aid donor conference in Kuwait, Ban said: 'I appeal to all sides and particularly the Syrian government, to stop the killing ... in the name of humanity, stop the killing, stop the violence.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The international envoy to Syria Lakhdar Brahimi warned that Syria is being destroyed and urged the security council to settle its differences over the crisis and get behind a plan for a political transition. Speaking to reporters after briefing the council he said: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syria is being destroyed bit by bit. And in destroying Syria, the region is being pushed into a situation that is extremely bad and extremely important for the entire world. That is why I believe the security council simply cannot continue to say ‘we are disagreement, therefore, let’s wait for better times’. I think they have got to grapple with this problem no. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Geneva declaration that contains, indeed, a lot of elements that would provide for a reasonable solution to the conflict cannot be implemented as it is. It needs action from the council and I have suggested a few ideas to them. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Rebel groups in Aleppo say they have recovered more than 100 bodies from a small river in the south of the city after what appears to be one of the biggest massacres to have taken place in the war-ravaged city. A video posted online today showed rows of bodies, most of them men in their 20s and 30s, with their hands tied behind their backs and evident bullet wounds to their heads. The graphic footage showed blood seeping from the corpses across silt left on the watercourse's concrete bank by floodwaters that have recently receded. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The Telegraph's Ruth Sherlock, who is in Aleppo, counted 79 bodies at the scene. She described how a father of two of the victims reacted. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'These are my sons,” said Abu Mohammed, 73, as he shuffled towards the corpses laid out in rows in a schoolyard. A relative held his arm, as he stared at the exposed faces of the victims. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] His legs buckled as he recognised the two young men, no older than 30 as his sons. They had travelled to central Aleppo, which is still in the hands of the Syrian government 20 days before. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] “They thought they had nothing to fear from the government, so they went to renew their identity cards. But they didn’t come back. Now I have found them here.” [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Barack Obama has announced an extra $155m (£98m) in humanitarian aid for Syria ahead of Wednesday's UN donor conference in Kuwait aimed at boosting the UN's record $1.5bn appeal for Syrians caught in the war. The US president urged the international community to do more to help. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The BBC has filmed Syrian rebels making homemade bombs close to the Syrian border. One of the bomb makers claimed civilians were warned to stay away from bomb attacks with warning signs. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Egypt [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • President Mohamed Morsi has ordered the police to act with restraint against peaceful protesters after human rights campaigners documented the excessive use of force in a wave of unrest that has killed more 50 people. Protests continued overnight in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Port Said, according to the Egypt Independent. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Egypt will remain on the 'edge of a precipice for years to come,' unless both Morsi's Islamist supporters and his opponents recognise that neither side will prevail and begin to work together, writes Magid Abelhadi. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A profound gap between those who want to turn the country into an Islamic state and those who want a modern democracy has been exposed. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Not only are there the usual disagreements over how to deal with spiralling debt, fight corruption and create jobs. There is no consensus on the rules of politics itself, something the controversy over the constitution has revealed. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The experience of Egypt's troubled transition has shown that neither side, at least in the foreseeable future, can prevail and rule alone. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Algeria [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • David Cameron is to visit to Algeria for talks with the country's prime minister aimed at forging what he promised would be a tough and intelligent alliance against terrorism in north Africa. He will be first western leader to visit Algeria since the recent terrorist assault on the country's gas installations that left 35 foreign energy workers dead and saw 36 militants killed by Algerian security forces.

world/2011/nov/27/arab-league-approves-sanctions-syria,2011-11-27,Syria defiant as Arab League votes for financial sanctions,"Syria is facing stiff sanctions imposed by the Arab League after President Bashar al-Assad refused to allow observers into the country to monitor violence that claimed dozens more lives at the weekend. Arab foreign ministers meeting in Cairo on Sunday agreed a package of measures designed to force Assad to end his security crackdown, free prisoners and launch reforms to find an end to the eight-month uprising. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] But there was no sign of any flexibility from a defiant Damascus regime, with opposition sources describing columns of Syrian tanks preparing to advance on Homs, the centre of recent heavy fighting. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The league decision halts transactions with Syria's central bank, freezes Syrian assets in other Arab states and Arab investment in Syria. It also imposes a travel ban on senior Syrian officials. Earlier, Arab finance and economy ministers stressed the need to avoid measures which would harm ordinary citizens. Basic commodities and cash remittances from Syrians working in other countries are to be exempt. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Announcement of the landmark agreement came from Qatar's prime minister, Hamad bin Jassem bin Jabr al Thani, who chaired the Cairo meeting. Bin Jassem said the decision, which is to take immediate effect, was backed by 19 of the league's 22 members. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Qatari leader had warned earlier that Arab failure to agree could lead to Libyan-style intervention by the west. 'All the work that we are doing is to avoid this,' he said, adding that if the international community did not see that Arabs were 'serious' he could not guarantee that such action could be avoided. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Turkey, which is not a member of the league but is encouraging Arab action, said it would implement the sanctions as well. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Opposition to sanctions seemed likely to weaken their impact. Iraq, Syria's largest Arab trading partner, abstained after making clear that it would not back punitive measures, partly in the light of its own experience under Saddam Hussein. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Lebanon, still dominated politically by its larger eastern neighbour, voted against. Both countries also opposed the league's recent decision to suspend Syria's membership. Still, combined with recent calls for Assad to step down – from immediate neighbours Jordan and Turkey as well as the US and many western countries – the measures are certain to add to the sense of isolation in Damascus. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Economists say the most damaging element is likely to be the freeze on assets in the Gulf. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Western governments are quietly monitoring the movement of capital out of Syria as a way of gauging the resilience of the regime and the big businessmen who are closely linked to it. EU and US sanctions are already in force. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The league said it had postponed a proposed ban on Arab civilian airlines from and to Syria but will impose it at a later date. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In Damascus, the state-run Al-Thawra newspaper slammed the proposed sanctions as 'targeting the Syrian people'. Pro-Syrian voices on Twitter and other social media sites suggested that only Israel would benefit. Others noted that the league action against Syria was more severe than against Egypt when it broke Arab consensus and signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The latest diplomatic moves had no discernible effect on the situation on the ground. By late afternoon the Syrian Revolution General Commission was reporting 28 dead, including 15 in Homs and six in the Damascus area. The Local Coordination Committees gave a figure of 26 deaths. Opposition sources reported 27 dead on Saturday while the government reported the burial of 22 armed forces personnel, including six pilots who were ambushed near Homs. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Sana, the Syrian state news agency, reported on the funerals on Sunday of nine members of the security forces who were killed by 'armed terrorist groups.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In another move that will likely deepen Assad's sense of isolation, the governments of Qatar and Bahrain both advised their nationals to leave Syria. The UAE issued a similar call last week.

world/middle-east-live/2012/apr/12/syria-ceasefire-begins,2012-04-12,"Syria ceasefire fragile, says UN chief - Thursday 12 April","6.14pm: Here's a summary of the main developments today: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syria [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The UN-Arab League envoy, Kofi Annan, said that a ceasefire supposed to take effect at 6am this morning 'appears to be holding'. But he reportedly told the UN security council that Syria had not fully complied with the terms of his peace plan and urged the 15-nation body to demand the withdrawal of troops and heavy weapons from towns. The UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon described the ceasefire as 'very fragile' and warned it could be broken anytime. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Both sides accused each other of violating the ceasefire. The opposition Syrian National Council said it was only being 'partially observed', with the Local Co-ordination Committees claiming 20 people have been killed by the security forces today. Syria's ambassador to the UN Bashar Ja'afari said rebels committed eight violations of the ceasefire on Thursday morning and the state news agency reported that an army officer was killed and 24 others injured by a bomb on a military bus. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Russia and China, who vetoed two UN security council resolutions condemning the Syria regime, urged that more be done to secure compliance with Annan's peace plan. The Chinese ambassador to the UN said the government pulling its troops out of towns and cities was as important as the ceasefire, while his Russian counterpart said a resolution approving unarmed UN observers - which he described as 'crucial' - could be passed tomorrow. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Egypt [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The Egyptian parliament has passed a law banning top level Mubarak-era officials from running for presidency. The ban includes ex-vice president and intelligence chief Omar Suleiman, who was running for office. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 5.56pm: Syria's ambassador to the UN Bashar Ja'afari has said that his government has already complied with Kofi Annan's demand for troop withdrawals, Reuters is reporting. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] He has also said that rebels committed eight violations of the ceasefire on Thursday morning. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 5.51pm: Syria: Russia and China, who both twice vetoed UN security council resolutions condemning the Assad regime, have been doing their bit to try to make sure that the window of opportunity offered by the ceasefire is not lost. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Russia's UN ambassador has said a resolution approving unarmed UN observers could be passed by the security council tomorrow. Vitaly Churkin said: 'It's crucial for the monitors to be on the ground. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Chinese UN ambassador said withdrawing troops from Syrian towns and cities is just as important as the ceasefire. Li Baodong said: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We fully support Kofi Annan's six-point plan and we believe the ceasefire is very important as is also pulling troops out of the towns and cities by the Syrian government ... very, very important. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 5.42pm: Syria: On Tuesday, France denounced Syria's assurance that its forces were complying with a UN-backed ceasefire deal as a 'blatant lie'. [NEW PARAGRAPH] Today, it has tempered its language so what. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In a statement issued by the French president's office after Nicolas Sarkozy held a conference call with Barack Obama, the two leaders called on the Syrian government to adhere 'scrupulously and without conditions' to the UN-backed plan. They also said they would intensify their efforts, including at the UN security council, to end the crisis. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 4.48pm: Syria: The Local Co-ordination Committees activist group claims that 11 people have been killed by the Syrian security forces so far today, six in Homs, four in Idlib and one in Damascus suburbs. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] By way of comparison, activist groups claimed over 100 people were killed on Tuesday, although the death toll reported yesterday was far lower. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A first lieutenant in the Syrian army was killed today and 24 officers wounded by a bomb on a military bus in Aleppo, the state news agency Sana says. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 4.36pm: Syria: A novel protest in Jabal al-Zawiya, Idlib...on motorbikes. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In Aleppo, a demonstration at the university has reportedly been broken up with teargas. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 4.19pm: Syria: The BBC's United Nations correspondent, Babara Plett, tweets that there is cautious optimism at the security council with respect to the ceasefire. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] #UN source: general view of SC members in #Annan briefing is #Syria ceasefire offers glimmer of hope, seize oppy to consolidate [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] — Barbara Plett (@BBCBarbaraPlett) April 12, 2012 [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 4.12pm: Syria: Kofi Annan has told the UN security council that Syria must withdraw its troops, council diplomats told Reuters on condition of anonymity. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Annan said that Syria has not fully complied with the terms of his peace plan and urged the 15-nation body to demand the withdrawal of troops and heavy weapons from towns, diplomats said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Annan also told the council that Syria's fragile truce needs support and called for the swift deployment of a first wave of unarmed observers to monitor implementation of his six-point peace plan, to be followed by a second wave of observers later. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 3.40pm: Syria: The joint UN-Arab League envoy, Kofi Annan, has said the ceasefire appears to be holding and has encouraged all parties to fully implement his peace plan. In a statement, he said: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] I am encouraged by reports that the situation in Syria is relatively quiet and that the cessation of hostilities appears to be holding. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syria is apparently experiencing a rare moment of calm on the ground. This is bringing much-needed relief and hope to the Syrian people who have suffered so much for so long in this brutal conflict. This must now be sustained. All parties have obligations to implement fully the 6-point plan. This includes both the military provisions of the plan and the commitment to move to a political process. I urge all Syrian to seize this opportunity. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The international community is determined to work with the Syrian people to support this process. The secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, will be asking the Security Council for approval of the deployment of a UN observer mission as soon as possible. This will allow us to move quickly to launch a serious political dialogue that will address the concerns and aspirations of the Syrian people. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] This is the time for all Syrians to come together in the hope that they can begin to heal their wounds and initiate a political transition to a democratic, plural political system, in which citizens have equal rights and equal opportunities, regardless of their affiliations or ethnicities or beliefs. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 3.31pm: Egypt: A group of 25 Egyptian human rights organisations have issued a statement objecting to a proposed new law to control NGOs: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Under this law civil society would be considered an institution of the government, and NGO staff would be regarded as civil servants ... This draft law actually epitomises the same philosophy of tightening the firm grip on civil society organisations in general and stifling human rights organisations in particular. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The new draft law goes even further in its restrictions than all of the previous laws which have repressed civil society since the proclamation of Law No 32 of 1964. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Arabist blog comments: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Of course the bill prohibits receiving funding from abroad without government approval, as previous legislation did, forcing many NGOs to register as legal corporations. It also bars membership in international NGO networks without government approval – meaning that, say, an Egyptian anti-torture group might not be able to join an anti-torture network. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The bill was prepared by the Ministry of Social Insurance, where clearly the same mindset and mentality as the old regime thrives. It's about time MPs start drafting their own laws rather than let Mubarak-era technocrats do it. The only question is whether the Islamist-dominated parliament might actually approve of this new text. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 3.24pm: Syria: Mona Mahmood has been speaking on the telephone to Abu Ayahim, in Sour Elzait village in Barada valley: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] I could not leave my house yesterday but today I'm able to take few steps in my neighbourhood – still not far away because I'm worried to leave the family alone at home. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] I have a grocery shop next door to my house but it is shut and can't open it again – I have no goods to sell, also I don't feel safe enough to be in my shop. I'm worried I might be taken by the soldiers. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Today the situation is better than yesterday. Most of the checkpoints were pulled out from the centre to the outskirts of the town. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A few shops are open and a few people are shopping. I must say that the village is disconnected from other towns because of so many checkpoints. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] I had a phone call with my friend Abu Ala'a in Zabadani and he told me a guy called Muhammed Hussein al-Namous was in detention but he died at the prison and they have a funeral for him today. We do not have any shooting here so far. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 3.09pm: Syria: The UN chief Ban Ki-moon has said that 'as of this moment, the situation looks calmer' but that the ceasefire is 'very fragile' and may be broken everytime. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The opposition say it is only being 'partially observed'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Ban told reporters in Geneva it may take just a gunshot to derail peace and that the 'onus is on Syria' to keep the government's promise and hold to a ceasefire. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] He said that 'the world is watching, however, with sceptical eyes, since many promises previously made by the government of Syria have not been kept'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The UN secretary-general said the government must ensure that its 'words will be matched by their deeds'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 2.28pm: Kuwait: In a crackdown on religious 'crimes', parliament today approved changes to the penal code that would extend the death penalty to those who curse God, the Prophet Muhammad or his wives. A demand from Shia MPs to also include the 12 revered Shia imams was rejected, al-Arabiya reports. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In order to become law, the change needs government approval and a further parliamentary vote. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The move follows the arrest last month of Hamad al-Naqi who was accused of blasphemous tweeting. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 2.03pm: Here's a brief summary of the main developments today: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The opposition Syrian National Council says a ceasefire that took effect at dawn is only being 'partially observed'. A tense calm was reported as guns fell silent in some areas but elsewhere security forces were reported to have shelled/opened fire on regime opponents. The Local Co-ordination Committees activist group claims five people have been killed by the security forces, while the state news agency, Sana, reported that a soldier has been killed in a bomb on a bus in Aleppo. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Syrian foreign affairs spokesman Jihad Makdissi said Syria was 'fully committed' to the ceasefire. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that President Assad retained the support of a 'majority' of Syrians. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The Syrian interior ministry urged gunmen 'who do not have blood on their hands' to turn themselves in to police in the knowledge they will be set free. Sana reported that 160 men from Damascus suburbs and Lattakia handed themselves in 'to return to their normal life'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 1.52pm: Syria: One officer died and 24 others, plus a number of civilians, were injured when a bus was attacked in Aleppo, the government news agency, Sana, reports: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] An official source told Sana correspondent that 'the blast took place at 8.00 am as an armed terrorist group targeted a military bus with an explosive device at the southern bypass area, near al-Nirab airport bridge in Aleppo.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The bus was carrying a number of officers and non-commissioned officers while on way to their workplace. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Director of Aleppo Military Hospital Brigadier General Dr Mohammad Osama Qashqash said that the injuries varied in degrees of severity, adding that three presons are in a critical condition. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 1.45pm: Syria: Mona Mahmood has been talking on Skype to a spokesman for the Free Syrian Army in Rastan (20 km north of Homs): [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] It is a very tense situation but the FSA is committed to the ceasefire. There is no movement outside and no shooting but snipers are on the tops of the houses and tanks are deployed in the streets. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Because of earlier attacks, most people have already left the town and are living in tents on the outskirts. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] There is no water supply in Rastan. We are depending on wells dug by some people in their homes. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Most of our food supplies are running out and no one can go shopping – all the shops are closed. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Last night we buried 10 martyrs who were killed at a funeral yesterday. They were killed by shabbiha (pro-regime thugs) and security forces. Most of their bodies had been burned so it was difficult to tell how they had been killed. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] I was told that in Homs more than 100 buses arrived last night, loaded with shabbiha and security forces. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 1.40pm: The Local Co-ordination Committees have named two more people they claim have been killed by the security forces today, both in al-Qusayr, Homs. They are Ghenwa Ahmad Jomrok (video: warning, distressing footage) and Ameen Habdoud (warning: graphic video). [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 1.26pm: The opposition Syrian National Council has told Reuters the ceasefire has been 'partially observed'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Burhan Ghalioun, exiled head of SNC said a test will be tomoorow when large demonstrations are expected after Friday prayers. Ghalioun said he did not trust the authorities who he said had their 'hand on the trigger'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Syrian people will go out tomorrow in the biggest possible numbers so that the Syrian people can express their will. While we call on the Syrian people to protest strongly... we ask them to be cautious because the regime will not respect the ceasefire and will shoot. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 1.22pm: The first post-ceasefire deaths have been reported by the Local-Co-ordination Committees activist group. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] It claims Shalah Abed Jawad Yaseen and Mohammed Jumaa Haj Qassem were killed in Janoudieh, Idlib, when regime forces attacked a demonstration. It says several people were also arrested. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The LCC also says security forces opened fire to disperse mourners at a funeral for 15-year-old Alaa al-Ahmed. This video purports to be of people fleeing at the funeral in Meridian in Aleppo city amid the sound of gunfire. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 1.17pm: Syrian gunmen 'who do not have blood on their hands' should turn themselves in to police in the knowledge they will be set free, the interior ministry said on Thursday. The announcement on state television came hours after a ceasefire was supposed to take effect. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The state news agency Sana reported that 160 men from Damascus suburbs and Lattakia handed themselves in 'to return to their normal life'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 1.07pm: Syria: Mona Mahmood has been talking on Skype to Omar Hamza, an engineer who lives in Saqba on the outskirts of Damascus. He told her: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] I'm at home now. I can't get out because there are two tanks stationed near my house. I don't feel safe enough to go out because there is a big deployment by the army. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Soldiers are checking the IDSs of people – looking for those who are wanted. Only few shops for food are open today ... old people and women are out to shop. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] All cars are checked before they can travel round the district. Some of the kids went to school but I could not send mine because I do not feel safe enough. I'm worried to let them go to school. We are trying to organise a demo but because of the heavy army deployment, we can't do that today. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 12.54pm: Syria/Turkey: A collection of photos from the Boynuyogun refugee camp in Turkey shows Syrian children's sketches of their dream homes. Inside the camp, the sides of tents have also been decorated with refugees' drawings [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 12.39pm: Bahrain: A significant number of patients – from all political and religious backgrounds - continue to avoid seeking medical care in public hospitals due to perceived discrimination, harassment, and ill treatment, the international medical humanitarian organisation Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said today. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] According to information shared with MSF, a sizable number of people injured during political demonstrations and suffering from mild to severe orthopaedic injuries, skin lacerations and respiratory distress resort to private healthcare because of fear of arrest in public hospitals. The fear among those seeking care remains despite government efforts to implement reforms recommended by the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry ... [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] At the beginning of March, [MSF] staff members were refused entry into the kingdom of Bahrain. As a result, the organisation has suspended activities in the country. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 12.33pm: Ahmad el-Khalaf, speaking to the Guardian via Skype, said several people have been shot in Idlib today (the conversation comes to an abrupt halt as the connection was lost): [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We can still hear the heavy use of gunfire on the people, however until this moment even though it's a bit early in the day I don't hear of anyone being killed. However, there's tens that are injured by the Assad fire inside Idlib city, inside Idlib province. Three are in very bad shape ... [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] He [Assad] usually shells ... with the use of tanks, with the use of a war helicopter, he has snipers everywhere where they shoot for fun. Unfortunately this is what's going on in Syria. He destroys houses, he destroys people, families ... [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We do not feel any safer. This [the ceasefire] seems something big for the outside world – 'Is he going to ceasefire or is he not?' – but for us inside Syria we are used to this unfortunately. We are used to these people playing with the Syrian people, people in charge playing games with the Syrian people. The Arab League playing games with the Syrian people, Obama and Cameron playing games with the Syrian people. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 12.23pm: This video purports to show the shelling reported in Qarabees Homs today. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Avaaz has produced a map showing where the ceasefire is holding and where it is not, based on local reports. We cannot vouch for its accuracy. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 11.54am: Syria: Some more updates on the ceasefire from Avaaz: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Heavy machine-gun fire can be heard in Idlib city, coming from the direction of the Farmers' Station. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Homs: Sniper shoots at pedestrian on Hama Road in Homs. Pedestrian sustains wound to the leg. Citizen journalists report sound of more sniper fire on Hama Road, which is close to Homs city centre. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 11.39am: Some activists and analysts have claimed that Assad will not honour a ceasefire because it will lead to even bigger demonstrations against his reign. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] So far, only a few demonstrations have been reported, including in Idlib and Deraa. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] This video shows students at Aleppo University spelling out 'SOS'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] There were clashes at the univeristy dorms between students and security forces on Tuesday. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 11.26am: The Local Co-ordination Committees activist group claims there has been shelling in Qarabees, in Homs, in violation of the ceasefire. We cannot independently verify the report. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 11.08am: A number of videos have been posted online purporting to show that Syrian forces are not withdrawing. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] This one is said to show a sniper on the roof of a hospital in Homs. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Another purports to show tanks in Aleppo province. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] This one is said to show troops present in Inkhel, in Deraa, in the south. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Under the Annan plan, government forces are supposed to withdraw from centres of population [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 10.49am: Syria: A couple of reports from the Local Coordinating Committees a few minutes ago: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Damascus Suburbs: Mouadamiyeh: New military reinforcement arrived the city, consists of vehicles, armored vehicles and cars loaded with anti-aircraft machine guns. In addition to the security checkpoints that are stationed at the municipal building and on the main street. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Aleppo: Atareb: Continuous presence of the military and snipers on rooftops despite the ultimatum having run up. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 10.29am: Syria: Joshua Landis, a Syria-watcher of long standing, reports conflict between between Arab tribes and Kurds in northern Aleppo. 'Relations between the two have always been tense but as the regime gets weaker clashes break out,' he writes in the Syria Comment blog, quoting an unnamed friend in Syria: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In Shak Maksoud and Ashrafia areas north of Aleppo city, clashes between Kurds (PKK affiliates) and Arabs (Bakkara tribe) have erupted for the second time in less than a month. The clashes began when a member of the Bakkara tribe allegedly killed a journalist affiliated with the PKK and the tribe refused to hand him over to the Kurds. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Shak Maksoud and Ashrafia areas have a majority Kurd population and a minority Arab population (most of them belong to the Bakkara tribe). The PKK has a strong influence among Kurds while the Bakkara has strong connections to the regime. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In the first occasion the clashes started with light weapons but when the Kurds succeeded in driving the Bakkara out of the area it turned into vandalism. Kurds started burning the houses of the defeated Bakkaras but spared the houses of those who did not fight. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Regime forces didn't intervene because they didn't want to take sides (since they have good relations with both sides) but rather tried to reconcile them. The situation is calm now but it could erupt at any moment. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 10.03am: Syria: A video posted on YouTube purports to show security forces setting up a barrier or checkpoint at the Arbaeen roundabout in Hama this morning. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 9.13am: Syria: In addition to the ceasefire, a key part of the Annan plan is withdrawal of government forces from centres of population. Reports so far suggest the regime has made little or no effort to do so. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Here is a description of the situation this morning from Avaaz (which the Guardian is not in a position to verify independently): [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Despite the suspension of hostilities by the regime, activists report that there is no evidence of the withdrawal of heavy machinery and troops in any of the provinces. The complete withdrawal of heavy machinery (including artillery and tanks) and troops from residential areas is a ceasefire term. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A total of 80 tanks are still stationed in the area of Sahel Ghab in Hama. They are stationed in the following villages: Al Saqalbiyeh, Al Ankawi, Al Rasif, Kfar Nabouda, Ain Al Taqa, Al Ziyara, Tal Waset, Qastoon, Hialin, and Al Sharia. Most of the tanks are T52 or T72 tanks. BTR armoured vehicles are also deployed. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Citizen journalist Zaher spoke to Avaaz from Zabadani: 'The tanks are still stationed on the outskirts of Zabadani, pointed in our direction. They could fire at us at any time.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In Deir Ezzor, the local coordination committee has reported that tanks are still deployed within the city centre. An independent activist claimed that the tanks had begun moving out of the city centre but residents in Deir Ezzor have not been able to go out in order to confirm their whereabouts. Both claims have not been verified. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Abu Wissam from Saqba, a town in the Damascus Suburbs, reported to Avaaz at 6:43 this morning: 'The tanks are still in their positions. They've placed sandbags in front of the tanks, piled so high that you cannot see the tanks behind them. But it's been completely quiet. The ceasefire is being upheld but there has been no move by the army to withdraw. Tanks and heavy artillery are still deployed across East Ghouta in the towns of Saqba, Hamoryah, Arbeen and Jisreen.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Citizen journalist Abu Rami reported from Homs: 'There has been no shooting and no shelling since 4:00 this morning… However, there does not seem to be any intention on the part of the army to withdraw from the city. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The checkpoints are still standing. Heavy artillery is still deployed and pointed at civilian neighbourhoods. Security forces and army troops are still deployed across the city. Snipers are still stationed atop high buildings. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The residents are happy about the ceasefire and hope that it will be maintained but there is some pessimism. We will have to see.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Abu Rami's testimony was recorded before the first instance of shooting in Homs at 6:25. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 9.08am: Syria: The Assad regime has no intention of breaking the ceasefire and has already made several military drawbacks, Syrian foreign affairs spokesman Jihad Makdissi told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Makdissi said the Syrian government was prepared to enter a process to end the conflict but said President Assad retained the support of a 'majority' of Syrians. He added that there could be no pre-conditions on any process, such as the departure of President Assad. He also said: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] There is no reason to break the ceasefire at all ... What is important is everybody should abide by the terms of calm. [Kofi Annan] is asking cessation of violence by all parties, not only the Syrian government. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] For our side we are fully committed for this ... We have a clear mechanism now in place, which is the Annan plan ... we are enabling him. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] It is not about President Assad ... the realistic prospect is it is up to Syrians themselves to decide ... Anybody who wants to change the regime in Syria, they should not be forcing this, they should do it through democratic channels. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] You have to be even-handed. The violence is mutual in Syria. I'm not saying we don't have problems in Syria ... What I am saying is the way out is evolution and not armed confrontation. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 8.56am: Syria: The Avaaz organisation says there have been four violations of the ceasefire, though no casualties have been reported. The Guardian cannot verify these reports independently. Here is the statement from Avaaz: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The first violation of the ceasefire occurred in Zabadani, in the Damascus Suburbs, when shelling that had begun in the Al Zalah area at 5:50 this morning continued up to 6:20, twenty minutes past the ceasefire deadline. At least five shells reportedly fell on Al Barada Street and the Al Zalah areas. Citizen journalists reported that the sounds were extremely loud yet there was no confirmation on the types of machinery used. One citizen journalist said: 'houses in our area were shaken to their very core, so it must have been tank fire'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The second violation occurred in Jabal Shahshabo, a mountain between Qalaat Al Madiq in Hama and Jabal Al Zawiyeh. Three shells landed on the mountain at 6:30 this morning. The mountain stretches across both the Hama and the Idlib governorates. The shells fell within the Hama governorate. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The third violation was confirmed through independent sources from Homs. Shells fell on Hama Road (Tareeq Hama), between the neighbourhoods of Jouret Shiyah and Khaldiyeh, at 8:47 local time. The shell originated from the Paint Factory on Mimas Road, close to the entrance of the neighbourhood of Al Waer. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Prior to the shelling, gunfire was heard at 6:25 and at 7:36. The location of the gunfire is still unconfirmed. At 9:05, three more rounds of gunfire were heard by a citizen journalist in Khaldiyeh, reportedly coming from Tareeq Hama, close to where the shells had fallen. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The fourth violation was recorded after 9:00 local time in Idlib. At this time, activists report that heavy machine gunfire can still be heard in Idlib city, coming from the direction of the Farmers' Station. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Avaaz has not been able to independently verify the circumstances of the shelling or gunfire, or the initiating party, in any of the instances. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] No casualties have been reported. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 8.49am: Bahrain: Speculation continues about the fate of the Formula One grand prix due to be held in Bahrain on April 22. The BBC says 'a number' of F1 teams expect it to be called off. A final decision is likely this weekend when the teams meet F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone, the BBC says. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Ecclestone, meanwhile, says the race will go ahead and can only be stopped by a request to do so from Bahrain. He is reported as telling Reuters today: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The race is on the calendar, it's scheduled. The only people that can do anything about it is the national sporting authority in the country that can ask for it to be withdrawn from the calendar. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Unless it gets withdrawn by the national sporting authority in the country, then we'll be there. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 8.23am: Bahrain: The United States has expressed deep concern about the situation in Bahrain. An unusually strong statement from the White House condemned 'the use of excessive force and indiscriminate use of tear gas against protesters' and urged the authorities 'to consider urgently all available options' in the case of imprisoned hunger striker Abdulhadi al-Khawaja. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The United States continues to be deeply concerned about the situation in Bahrain, and we urge all parties to reject violence in all its forms. We condemn the violence directed against police and government institutions, including recent incidents that have resulted in serious injuries to police officers. We also call on the police to exercise maximum restraint, and condemn the use of excessive force and indiscriminate use of tear gas against protesters, which has resulted in civilian casualties. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We continue to underscore, both to the government and citizens of Bahrain, the importance of working together to address the underlying causes of mistrust and to promote reconciliation. In this respect, we note our continued concern for the well-being of jailed activist Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja and call on the Government of Bahrain to consider urgently all available options to resolve his case. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] More broadly, we urge the government to redouble its ongoing efforts to implement the recommendations of the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry, and renew our call for the government, opposition parties, and all segments of Bahraini society to engage in a genuine dialogue leading to meaningful reforms that address the legitimate aspirations of all Bahrainis. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 7.51am: Syria: Some comment from China's foreign ministry now which has called on the Syrian opposition to honour the ceasefire agreement, releasing a statement on its website. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] China welcomes the government's relevant decision, which will help to ease tensions. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] China also calls on the Syrian armed opposition to immediately cease fire and implement Annan's six-point proposal. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 7.39am: Syria: Some updated information from the situation on the ground in Syria this morning. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Rami Abdul-Rahman, who heads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said all flashpoints in the central provinces of Hama and Homs, the northern regions of Idlib and Aleppo, the capital, Damascus and its suburbs, as well as Daraa to the south and Deir el-Zour to the east were quiet. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'Nothing is happening in these hotspots so far,' he said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In Homs, activist Tarek Badrakhan said no explosions or shelling have been heard since 10pm Wednesday, but that army vehicles were still in the streets on Thursday. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 7.32am: Syria: Meantime David Cameron who is currently on a tour of South East Asia has urged Russia and China to join the world in 'tightening the noose' around the Syrian regime. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Prime Minister told BBC Radio 5 that Bashar Assad's 'deliberate flouting' of the latest peace plan showed that further action was needed. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] I feel an immense sense of frustration because the world has come together behind this Kofi Annan plan. This is a plan, remember, that is not just backed by those of us who have been pushing for action on Syria, it's also backed by China and Russia. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] And yet Assad is deliberately flouting it. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Now is the time to say to the Russians and Chinese, look at the man we are dealing with, look at the appalling way he is behaving. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We need to go back to the UN and tighten the pressure, tighten the noose. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 7:25am: Syria: The 6am deadline for a ceasefire in Syria has passed and the situation remains quiet so far in compliance with Kofi Annan's UN-backed peace plan. However there remains widespread doubts from the international community that Syria will comply. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] While Syria said on Wednesday that it would abide by the ceasefire it has reserved the right to respond to attacks and the main armed rebel group said it would not stop shooing if government forces attacked. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Syrian army has also shown few signs of withdrawing troops from urban areas, something supposed to have begun on Tuesday under the ceasefire plan. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Annan had received written assurances from the Syrian foreign ministry that government troops would 'cease all military fighting throughout Syrian territory as of 06:00 ... while reserving the right to respond proportionately to any attacks carried out by armed terrorist groups', his spokesman, Ahmad Fawzi said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Meantime the US has said Syria's pledge has 'little if any credibility' and that caveats placed by President Bashar al-Assad's government on the ceasefire are worrying. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We will be following the situation as it unfolds.

world/2012/jul/17/syria-crisis-damascus-clashes-live,2012-07-17,Syria crisis: Damascus clashes continue - Tuesday 17 July 2012,"5.00pm: Here's a roundup of the latest developments: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syria [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Serious clashes continue in various parts of Damascus for the third consecutive day, though activists differ on whether they represent the start of a battle for control of the Syrian capital (see 1.44pm). A senior figure in the Free Syrian Army said today that the 'battle for the liberation of Damascus has begun' (see 2.55pm). An activist in Damascus told the Guardian the latest developments are 'the turning point' but added: 'We are not talking about them [the FSA] taking full control, we are talking about hit and run tactics' (see 4.15pm). [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The most senior Syrian politician to defect to the opposition claimed that major bombings across Syria had been orchestrated by the regime in collaboration with al-Qaida, the BBC reports. Nawas al-Fares, Syria's former, said: 'Al-Qaida is searching for space to move and means of support, the regime is looking for ways to terrorise the Syrian people.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Britain is to train and equip an additional 20 Syrian human rights activists to join 47 who were trained earlier this year and have been gathering evidence of the Assad regime's crimes against its own civilians, foreign secretary William Hague announced today (see 1.31pm). [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • More than 500 Syrians, including several army officers, fled to Turkey on Monday, according to the Turkish daily Zaman. The Syrians include one general, four colonels, one lieutenant colonel, there majors, six captains, one lieutenant and many soldiers with their families, it said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Kofi Annan met President Putin in Moscow today and said afterwards: 'We've had a very good discussion' (see 4.26pm). [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Egypt [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Brawls broke out in a courtroom today as judges tried to debate rulings that could either bolster the country's new Islamist president, Mohamed Morsi, or undermine him in his power struggle with the military (see 1.42pm). [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Ousted president Hosni Mubarak is back in prison after being switched to a military prison following a health scare last month, the Egypt Independent reports. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] UAE [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Three Emirati Islamists including a prominent lawyer were arrested today as part of a widening clampdown on Islamist dissidents, Reuters reports citing relatives and activists (see 12.09pm). [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Tunisia [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Rachid Ghannouchi, the founder of Tunisia's Ennahda party which heads the post-revolution government has been re-elected as its leader – though not without some opposition (see 11.35am). [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 4.40pm: Syria: A note just received from prominent activist Rose al-Homsi: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A military campaign on the districts of the capital Damascus continues for the third day in a row. Today the campaign has been focused on al-Qaboon since night time, where regime forces began cordoning off the area from all directions. Then, extremely heavy mortar and tank shelling started, alongside the participation of helicopter shelling. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Security forces and the army remain deployed, accompanied by tanks and armoured vehicles, in al-Midan district, where clashes take place from time to time. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] For the first time, clashes took place in al-Mazra'ah area in the centre of Damascus, in the vicinity of the headquarters of the Ba'ath party, in addition to clashes in Barzeh, al-Tadamun, al-Zahirah, Mukhayam Yarmouk [Yarmouk camp], al-Qadam, al-Asalee, Nahr Aisha and other areas. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Regime forces brought in large reinforcements of soldiers, armoured vehicles and tanks inside the capital, with a spreed of checkpoints and blocking off roads leading to security centres in most areas of the capital. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Reinforcements were also brought to entrances of the capital that link it to the suburbs. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 4.35pm: Syria: The foreign ministry has complained that 'politicised decisions' adopted by the UN Human Rights Council have 'given the green light to the armed terrorist groups to go ahead in the acts of killing against the Syrian people', the government news agency reports. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In a report to the UN secretary-general it said: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Time has come for the Human Rights Council and those who mislead it to abandon the accusations pointed to Syria and to direct these accusations to their right place; the armed terrorist groups which perpetrate acts of killing against the Syrian people, target the national interests in addition to its ignorance to the difficult impacts of 60 bulks of sanctions and coercive measures imposed by states that claim commitment to the Syrian people's rights. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 4.26pm: Syria: Media statement from Kofi Annan, the joint special envoy for Syria, following his meeting with President Vladimir Putin in Moscow today: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We've had a very good discussion with the president, discussing the situation and the crisis in Syria, focusing on what measures need to be taken to end the violence and the killing and how we move on to the political transition. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Obviously, the discussions in the security council regarding the resolution also came up. And I would hope that the council will continue its discussions and hopefully find language that will pull everybody together for us to move forward on this critical issue. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] As I said earlier, we need to do whatever we can to stop the violence, to stop the killing, and the council, I expect, will be sending a message out, that the killing must stop and the situation on the ground is unacceptable. Hopefully, the council will come together in a united manner and press ahead in search of peace. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 4.23pm: Syria: The FSA claims to have brought down a military helicopter involved in the shelling of Harasta and al-Qabun districts of Damascus, Now Lebanon says, citing the Saudi-owned al-Arabiya TV. There is currently no confirmation from other sources. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Meanwhile, the video above, posted on YouTube today, purports to show an armoured vehicle captured by anti-Assad forces in the Midan district of Damascus. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 4.15pm: Syria: 'You can hear gunfire, explosions, the sounds of shelling, helicopters are flying over Damascus,' according to Lena, a spokeswoman for the Revolution Leadership Council in Damascus. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Speaking via Skype from the Syrian capital she said: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] There are fights going on. Aircraft [helicopters] are shelling the areas of Midan, Jobar, Qaboon. This is the turning point that the regime is shelling Damascus ... Damascenes are leaving their homes to find shelter in other neighbourhoods. That didn't happen before. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Lena said rebels enjoyed significant support in the city, but they are too weak militarily to take over the city. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Free Syrian Army is supported by the people, because we know that they are are only hope, after the whole world has failed us. We have to go through the battle in order to stay alive. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We are not talking about them taking full control, we are talking about hit and run tactics. This is what the Free Syrian Army is opting for ... We back them up 100% we trust their choices. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We are not expecting this to end soon. We could see it coming. We knew that what happened in other cities of Syria, like Homs, Deraa, Idlib, Deir Ezzor is about to come to Damascus. We were hoping for this not to be true. We were hoping for a political solution, but of course the regime refused any kind of political solution. Russia is still backing up the Syrian regime, so they have left us no way out. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We have no other choice. We have to stand up on our own even if it takes a long time. Now this is in Damascus, this is the last frontier. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 3.20pm: Syria: The Assad regime has moved troops from the Golan Heights to reinforce Damascus, according to the Israeli army intelligence chief. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Lebanon's Daily Star quoted Major General Aviv Kochav telling MPs: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Assad has removed many of his forces that were in the Golan Heights to the areas of (internal) conflict. He's not afraid of Israel at this point, but mainly wants to augment his forces around Damascus. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 2.55pm: Syria: A senior figure in the Free Syrian Army said today that the 'battle for the liberation of Damascus has begun'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Colonel Qassim Saadeddine, Homs-based spokesman for the FSA's Joint Command, said the fighting will not stop until the whole of the capital has been conquered, the Lebanese LBCI website reports. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'We have transferred the battle from Damascus province to the capital,' Saadeddine is quoted as saying. 'We have a clear plan to control the whole of Damascus. We only have light weapons, but it's enough.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Saadeddine has emerged as a key figure in the free army. Last month he was filmed inspecting rebels troops firing RPGs against government forces in Rastan. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In May he defied the Turkish leadership of the FSA by issuing the Assad regime with a 48-hour deadline to abide by a battered ceasefire brokered by Kofi Annan. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Since that deadline elapsed on 1 June, the FSA has stepped up its attacks on government forces. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 2.32pm: Syria: There are reports that another member of the Tlass family has defected. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Al-Jazeera: Syrian colonel Ziad Tlass arrives in Jordan following defection [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] — NOW Syria (@NOW_Syria) July 17, 2012 [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Manaf Tlass, a prominent Republican Guard general who defected to Paris earlier this month, is expected to a deliver a speech in the next few days. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The report is unconfirmed at this stage and we are not clear how Ziad is related to Manaf. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] He doesn't appear on the Guardian's Tlass family tree. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 2.31pm: Syria: One little-reported aspect of the conflict is casualties among the Syrian military. Under the headline: 'The other side of Syria's civil war', Foreign Policy has a series of sombre pictures showing flag-draped coffins, mourners and military funerals. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'Death comes for Bashar al-Assad's soldiers, too,' it says. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 2.05pm: Syria: An update from the International Committee of the Red Cross which also explains the changed situation in terms of humanitarian law: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] There has recently been an escalation in fighting between government forces and armed opposition groups, especially in Rural Damascus. The ICRC and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent are responding to the most urgent needs of residents and displaced people in several parts of the country. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Fighting has been taking place continuously in Homs governorate and Deir Ezzor and sporadically in Dar'a, where the number of displaced people is growing fast. The situation in the rural areas of Aleppo governorate is also still very tense, especially in northern villages. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] As a result, an increasing number of people are struggling to preserve their safety and their livelihoods, and thousands of people are fleeing to take refuge with families, friends or other people. To meet the growing needs, the ICRC is providing help together with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent for people in northern Syria. 'Since mid-2011, we have brought aid to over 600,000 people jointly with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent,' said Robert Mardini, the ICRC's head of operations for the Near and Middle East. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] As the situation has evolved, the ICRC has continued to monitor the conflict in the country. The ICRC concludes that there is currently a non-international (internal) armed conflict occurring in Syria opposing Government Forces and a number of organised armed opposition groups operating in several parts of the country (including, but not limited to, Homs, Idlib and Hama). [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Thus, hostilities between these parties wherever they may occur in Syria are subject to the rules of international humanitarian law. These rules impose limits on how the fighting can be conducted, with the aim of protecting the civilian population and persons not, or no longer, directly participating in the hostilities. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'As a neutral and independent humanitarian organisation with a mandate to promote respect for international humanitarian law, the ICRC's preferred way of addressing humanitarian issues is through bilateral and confidential dialogue,' said Mr Mardini. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'This approach enables us to obtain and preserve access to the people most affected by armed conflict or other violence and to the warring parties themselves.' The ICRC and its staff cannot be compelled to testify before any court or tribunal. Its documents and reports, including those shared with the authorities, cannot be used as evidence in any legal proceedings. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 2.00pm: Here's a roundup of the latest developments: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syria [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Serious clashes are continuing in Damascus for the third consecutive day, though activists differ on whether they represent the start of a battle for control of the Syrian capital (see 1.44pm). [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The most senior Syrian politician to defect to the opposition claimed that major bombings across Syria had been orchestrated by the regime in collaboration with al-Qaida, the BBC reports. Nawas al-Fares, Syria's former, said: 'Al-Qaida is searching for space to move and means of support, the regime is looking for ways to terrorise the Syrian people.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Britain is to train and equip an additional 20 Syrian human rights activists to join 47 who were trained earlier this year and have been gathering evidence of the Assad regime's crimes against its own civilians, foreign secretary William Hague announced today (see 1.31pm). [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon is expected in China as part of a diplomatic push ahead of a UN vote of a draft resolution that threatens sanctions against the Assad regime. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • More than 500 Syrians, including several army officers, fled to Turkey on Monday, according to the Turkish daily Zaman. The Syrians include one general, four colonels, one lieutenant colonel, there majors, six captains, one lieutenant and many soldiers with their families, it said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, accused the west of using 'blackmail' to try to secure a binding security council resolution against Damascus. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Egypt [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Brawls broke out in a courtroom today as judges tried to debate rulings that could either bolster the country's new Islamist president, Mohamed Morsi, or undermine him in his power struggle with the military (see 1.42pm). [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Ousted president Hosni Mubarak is back in prison after being switched to a military prison following a health scare last month, the Egypt Independent reports. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • President Mohamed Morsi is due to announce the name of his prime minister today, Ahram online reports. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] UAE [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Three Emirati Islamists including a prominent lawyer were arrested today as part of a widening clampdown on Islamist dissidents, Reuters reports citing relatives and activists (see 12.09pm). [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Tunisia [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Rachid Ghannouchi, the founder of Tunisia's Ennahda party which heads the post-revolution government has been re-elected as its leader – though not without some opposition (see 11.35am). [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 1.44pm: Syria: Activists differ on whether the latest clashes in the Syrian capital represent the start of the battle for Damascus. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Speaking above the intermittent sound of helicopter rotors, Ameer, from the northern suburb of Barzeh, told the Guardian: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] These clashes in the capital mark a new stage in the Syrian revolution. It is close now. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The regime has tried hard in the last year and half to make Damascus [isolated] from what's going on outside - to make Damascus quiet. They succeeded in the past, but yesterday there was shelling here, and [today] there was shelling on al-Qaboon and shelling on the south. Suddenly Damascus is in the centre of the action. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Inside Barzeh there is no sign of government presence. I think they don't dare to fight here. They are stuck in Midan and Qaboon. They are too busy to come here. They used to storm my neighbourhood three times a week. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] But Tarek, spokesman for Revolution Leadership Council in Damascus, suggested the latest clashes still represent only skirmishes. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Speaking via Skype from Salehiya north-east of the centre, he said: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] I can't say this is the battle for Damascus. The Free Syrian Army didn't start this fight, so I don't believe this is the one. But developments on ground will determine whether it spreads to other areas. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] He said gunfire was heard in Mazraa to the north of this centre this morning. He speculated that this could have been sounded as a way 'distract the army from the southern part of the city'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] He added: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Free Syrian Army didn't start this fight. It was an operation by the army to put pressure on demonstrators, and the Free Syrian Army. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] There are threats from regime forces that they will bombard the southern part of the city - they have stationed tanks and artillery in the southern parts of the city. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 1.42pm: Egypt: Brawls broke out in a courtroom today as judges in Cairo tried to debate rulings that could either bolster the country's new Islamist president, Mohamed Morsi, or undermine him in his power struggle with the military. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Hundreds of Morsi's supporters came to protest at the courthouse, accusing the generals of using the judiciary to undermine his authority, Reuters reports. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Legal opinion is split on whether the Cairo administrative court will strike down Egypt's constituent assembly, formed by an Islamist-dominated parliament with the tasked of re-writing Egypt's constitution. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The divisions were reflected at the court, where members of the public pushed and elbowed lawyers and one other, angrily shouting demands and counter demands. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'Down, down with military rule,' cried supporters of the Brotherhood who want the constituent assembly to continue its work. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] That drew an angry response from their opponents. 'Down, down with the rule of the (Brotherhood's) Supreme Guide,' shouted a woman as the courtroom descended into mayhem. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'Cancel the session,' said lawyer Nabiel Gabriel. 'This isn't justice... I am holding Mursi personally accountable for this chaos. He has a responsibility to establish order.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Judge Abdel Salam el-Naggar told the crowd the court would not be intimidated and suspended proceeedings to allow the atmosphere to cool before reconvening lawyers in a separate court chamber. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 1.31pm: Syria: Britain is to step up its support for those documenting the Assad regime's crimes against its own civilians, foreign secretary William Hague announced today. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The UK will train and equip an additional 20 Syrian human rights activists to join 47 who were trained earlier this year and have been gathering evidence for the UN since April, Hague said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] His announcement came during a visit to the Bashabsheh refugee camp in Jordan, near the border with Syria, the Press Association reports. In the camp he met some of the thousands of people who have fled their homes after civilian areas came under assault from military forces loyal to president Bashar Assad. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Hague is quoted as saying: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Today I have seen first-hand the terrible price being paid by the Syrian people and heard harrowing accounts of how they have suffered. It is more clear than ever that we must work to ensure that there is no impunity for those committing violations and abuses in Syria. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] They must understand that their actions have consequences, that acting on behalf of the regime does not absolve them of responsibility, and that we are committed to doing all that we can to hold them to account ... [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] I have therefore announced that the UK will train a further 20 human rights activists to interview victims and record what is happening on the ground, so that the evidence can be used in future trials. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] I pay tribute to the commitment and dedication of those undertaking this vital work, which often places them at great personal risk. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 12.22pm: Syria: AP says the use of helicopters over Damascus marks a 'clear escalation' of the clashes in the capital. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'I can hear cracks of gunfire and some explosions from the direction of Midan,' al-Shami told The Associated Press via Skype. 'Black smoke is billowing from the area.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Dutch journalist Sander van Hoorn tweets a distant image of a helicopter over the Syrian capital: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Helicopter over central #Damascus heading south. #syria twitter.com/svhoorn/status… [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] — Sander van Hoorn (@svhoorn) July 17, 2012 [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] There are differing accounts of requests to allow people to flee the Midan area. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Maria Finoshina, a reporter for Russia Today which has been largely sympathetic to the Assad government, suggested a rebel request to allow 'terrorists' to leave had been refused.

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The arrests brought the number of detained Emirati dissidents, most of them Islamists, to 10 since Sunday, when the Gulf Arab state said it was investigating a foreign-linked group planning 'crimes against the security of the state'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The UAE, a major oil exporter, allows no organised political opposition. It has avoided the political unrest that has toppled four Arab heads of state since last year thanks in part to its cradle-to-grave welfare system. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] But it has also moved swiftly against dissidents, and last year stripped citizenship from Islamists whom it deemed a security threat and jailed activists who called for more power for a semi-elected advisory council. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Lawyer Mohammed al-Roken, his son and son-in-law were detained on Tuesday, activists and family members said. All are linked to the local Islamist group al-Islah (Reform), which has been the target of a crackdown in the UAE. Roken represented seven Islamists stripped of citizenship last year. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'He (Roken) was taken by security officials at 2am in the morning when he was out with the driver looking for his son and son-in-law who were also arrested,' a relative told Reuters.

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In a press conference yesterday, president of the congress Nejmeddine Hamrouni acknowledged that some younger members of the party indeed held more conservative views that were in conflict with the moderate line so far extolled publicly by the party. In March, Ennahdha announced it would not push for Islamic law to be made the basis of Tunisia's new constitution. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 11.09am: Syria: A deputy police chief, Brigadier Issa Duba, is reported (in Arabic, by a pro-Assad website) to have died from wounds sustained during the clashes in Damascus. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Meanwhile, activist Shakeeb al-Jabri claims more than 200 soldiers have been injured or killed during the last 48 hours in Damascus.

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'Obama has been very reluctant to lead on Syria,' Landis said. That 'has been a smart policy' but it may not stay that way, he said, citing the rising death toll and fragmentation of the country. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'I'm very pessimistic about the future of Syria and that's what makes me so hesitant about jumping in,' he told an audience at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. At the same time, he said 'decapitation [of the regime] might work,' eliminating a president who is increasingly detached from reality. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Bashar al-Assad 'is living in this little world [where] everyone else is an extremist,' Landis said. Assad is a 'loser' and 'will never be able to put Syria back together again.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Landis said his criteria for whether the US should do more than provide humanitarian and other non-lethal support for the opposition was whether that would improve the situation. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 10.31am: Syria: The Guardian's interactive map showing recent clashes in Damascus has now been updated to take account of the latest developments. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We'll continue to update it while the clashes continue. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 9.55am: Syria: The conflict within Syria is being played out far beyond the country's borders, not only at the UN but also on the internet where it is generating much heat, especially on the political left. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Robin Yassin-Kassab, author of The Road from Damascus, is the latest to join the fray. In a post on his Qunfuz blog (it's Arabic for 'hedgehog'), he decries 'blanket thinkers' from 'the infantile left'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The problem with blanket thinkers is that they are unable to adapt to a rapidly shifting reality. Instead of evidence, principles and analytical tools, they are armed only with ideological blinkers. Many of the current crop became politicised by Palestine and the invasion of Iraq, two cases in which the imperialist baddy is very obviously American. As a result, they read every other situation through the US-imperialist lens ... [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] This in turn leads to grossly unfair portrayals of the people resisting oppression in Syria, he says. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] At best they are passive tools. They are also depicted as wild Muslims, bearded and hijabbed, who do not deserve democracy or rights because they are too backward to use them properly. Give them democracy and they'll vote for the Muslim Brotherhood, and slaughter the Alawis and drive the Christians to Beirut. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The blanket thinkers search for evidence of crimes committed by the popular resistance, and when they find them (usually on very flimsy evidence) they use them to smear the entire movement. They demand the resistance negotiate with a regime which has proved again and again that its only strategy is slaughter. They demand that the people remain peaceful as their children are tortured, their women raped, their neighbourhoods levelled. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Leftist blanket thinkers do not apply the same criteria to the popular resistance of the Palestinians. It's Zionists who do that. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The attitudes that Yassin-Kassab addresses – and the conspiracy theories they generate – will be familiar to readers of the Guardian's discussion threads. Our diplomatic editor, Julian Borger, also discussed some of them in an article for Comment is free last week. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Borger was responding to an article by comedy writer Charlie Skelton which was warmly received by the Assad regime – it was featured on Syrian TV, on the government's Syria Online website and praised on Russia Today. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 9.31am: Syria: The Dutch journalist Sander van Hoorn reports an explosion and gunfire in central Damascus. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Explosion followed by some gunshots close to or in downtown. Waiting with UN to move out. #Syria [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] — Sander van Hoorn (@svhoorn) July 17, 2012 [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] More video footage from activists purports to show tanks on the streets of the Syrian capital. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] It is unclear which neighbourhood the tanks were filmed. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 8.31am: (all times BST) Fighting is reported to be continuing in Damascus for a third day as UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon leads a diplomatic push in China ahead of a vote in the security council. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Here's a roundup of the latest developments: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syria [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Syrian army armoured vehicles have clashed with rebels in Damascus in what residents said was the heaviest fighting in the capital since the revolt against President Bashar al-Assad began 17 months ago, Reuters reports. Armoured vehicles rolled into the southern Damascus district of Midan on Monday and were reinforced by security forces surrounding the area. Residents said they saw snipers deployed on rooftops. 'There are troops everywhere, I can hear ambulances,' said a resident near Midan. 'It feels like a war in Damascus.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The most senior Syrian politician to defect to the opposition claimed that major bombings across Syria had been orchestrated by the regime in collaboration with al-Qaida, the BBC reports. Nawas al-Fares, Syria's former, said: 'Al-Qaida is searching for space to move and means of support, the regime is looking for ways to terrorise the Syrian people.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The International Committee of the Red Cross's designation of the conflict as a civil war reflects the extent to which the Assad regime's counter-insurgency is backfiring, argues Julian Borger. Every time it sends troops to quell opposition in a city, district or village, its blunderbuss use of artillery and air power has claimed more and more innocent lives, alienating one slice of society after another. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon is expected in China as part of a diplomatic push ahead of a UN vote of a draft resolution that threatens sanctions against the Assad regime. The resolution would extend a UN observer mission in Syria for 45 days and place international envoy Kofi Annan's peace plan under Chapter 7 of the UN charter. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • More than 500 Syrians, including several army officers, fled to Turkey on Monday, according to the Turkish daily Zaman. The Syrians include one general, four colonels, one lieutenant colonel, there majors, six captains, one lieutenant and many soldiers with their families, it said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Manaf Tlass, a prominent Republican Guard general who defected to Paris earlier this month, is expected to a deliver a speech in the next few days aimed at underlining his claims to a post-Assad leadership position. 'He is going to approach the political, military, and social vision for the future,' a close friend of the Tlass family told the Guardian. The family friend said that Tlass was consulting foreign governments as well as the opposition Syrian National Council about the speech. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, accused the west of using 'blackmail' to try to secure a binding security council resolution against Damascus. RIA Novosti quoted him saying: 'To our great distress, we see elements of blackmail. They tell us, if you don't give us an agreement on accepting the [UN Security Council] resolution on Article 7 of the United Nations, then we will refuse to prolong the UN Observer Mission mandate'. The mandate of the mission expires this Friday. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Egypt [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Ousted president Hosni Mubarak is back in prison after being switched to a military prison following a health scare last month, the Egypt Independent reports. Its sources said he was transferred to Tora prison hospital in a motorcade after doctors declared his condition was stable. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • President Mohamed Morsi is due to announce the name of his prime minister today, Ahram online reports. It speculates that the eagerly-awaited appointment will go to an economist.

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The pullout from the northern city was ordered just after sunrise on Thursday after a night of intensive attacks by planes and tanks on all three rebel frontlines. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Free Syrian Army (FSA) commanders claimed the withdrawal was tactical and said a small force had stayed behind to oppose any advance by government forces. But the move seemed to mark a significant moment in the fight for control of southern Aleppo, which had raged for more than two weeks, claiming several hundred casualties. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In Damascus, meanwhile, the FSA announced the defection of Muheddine Musalmani, President Assad's protocol chief. But a state TV channel said he would issue a statement denying the claim. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Last week, Assad's prime minister, Riyad Hijab, a veteran Ba'ath party member, became the most senior Syrian political figure yet to defect, appearing in Jordan on Wednesday. Hijab's replacement was named on Thursday as Wael al-Halqi, formerly the health minister. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Iran – a close ally of Syria – called for 'serious and inclusive' talks between Assad's government and the opposition as it hosted a conference for 29 countries that it said had 'realistic' views on the escalating crisis. None of the participating countries has called on Assad to quit or backed opposition groups. Only Iraq, Pakistan and Zimbabwe sent their foreign ministers. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Fighting was reported on Thursday in the Damascus area, Hama and Deraa. Shelling also intensified in other parts of Aleppo which had notionally been held by the FSA since it secured its foothold in Salahedin in late July. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The regime push had been widely expected earlier this week and rebels had vowed to defend their ground. However, commanders said the intensity of the shelling meant their fighters now had too few opportunities to take cover. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'They were shelling the buildings at the frontline all night,' said Major Abu Furad, who led one of the main units in Salahedin, Katibat al-Ansar. 'The buildings were falling in front of us. It was impossible to stay there.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The rebel group had been occupying an area known as street 15, which faced a regime force around 200 metres away. Both sides had traded small arms fire for the past fortnight, but neither had advanced beyond their positions. 'We withdrew to street 10, which [runs parallel] behind street 15, 150 metres back,' he said. 'But the regime was shelling that street too. It was relentless and no one could stay behind. They have started using bigger bombs from planes. They were far bigger than the shells from the tanks.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The FSA leadership in Aleppo said it was now redeploying its forces to other key areas of the city. It claimed its ousting from Salahedin had not damaged morale and maintained that the regime was continuing to hold back its ground forces because it fears many would defect if they were ordered to enter the city. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'That's what the defectors are telling us,' said Sheikh Tawfik Abu Sleiman, leader of one of the Aleppo brigades. 'They would shed their uniforms and run away.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Shelling intensified throughout Thursday in other areas of Aleppo that had previously seen limited fighting. The FSA said it was responding by launching attacks in the centre of the city, where regime troops and the loyalist shabiha militia were stationed to defend key state institutions. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The FSA in Aleppo seemed to be united in a plea for an internationally enforced no-fly zone, which would ground the Syrian air force jets now playing an increasing role in the campaign. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'That's all we need,' said Abu Hanefa. 'No guns, no armies, just the ability to get these things out of the sky. They are killing us.' Another rebel leader, who had left Salahedin, said: 'Even the bravest among us had to acknowledge that these jets are something that we cannot fight. It is one thing being outgunned by tanks, but planes are creating a very, very difficult situation.'

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the pre-dawn skirmish in the north-western city of Idlib killed seven soldiers and police officers, as well as five anti-government army defectors and three civilians. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Security forces also killed a civilian in the southern province of Deraa, six in the central region of Homs and three others in areas near Idlib, the activist group said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The fighting came a day after the UN's human rights chief called on the international community to protect Syrian civilians. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Navi Pillay, the UN high commissioner for human rights, told an emergency meeting of the UN human rights council in Geneva: 'In light of the manifest failure of the Syrian authorities to protect their citizens, the international community needs to take urgent and effective measures to protect the Syrian people.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] More than 4,000 people have been killed since the pro-democracy uprising against President Bashar al-Assad's hardline regime began in mid-March.

world/2012/may/28/syria-massacre-opposition-shares-blame-russian,2012-05-28,"Syria massacre: opposition forces share blame, says Russian minister","Russia's foreign minister has said opposition forces shared responsibility for weekend massacres in Syria and gave little sign that Moscow's position would change following the fresh atrocities. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Speaking at a joint press conference on Monday with the British foreign secretary, William Hague, Sergei Lavrov said that both the regime of Bashar al-Assad and the armed opposition were to blame for the deaths of more than 100 people in Houla and Hama, including dozens of children. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'We are dealing with a situation in which both sides evidently had a hand in the deaths of innocent citizens,' Lavrov said. He called for a thorough investigation into the massacres, saying 'guilt must be decided objectively'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Although it supported a UN security council resolution on Sunday night condemning the Syrian government's shelling of Houla, Russia has put serious effort into spreading its message that the blame did not lie with Assad's regime alone. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] It has supported the Syrian government's position that outside forces like al-Qaida are behind the violence. Russia continues to supply arms to Assad, the Kremlin's main ally in the Middle East. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Lavrov did appear to take some steps to distance the Kremlin from Assad. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'For us it's not most important who is in power in Syria. We must secure an end to the violence, an end to the death, and start a political dialogue in which Syrians can decide the fate of their own country,' he said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Yet at the same time, he devoted much more effort to accusing unnamed outside forces of seeking to undertake regime change in Syria under the guise of security. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] He accused outside actors of 'playing a dishonest game' by espousing calls for peace while working towards their true goal of removing Assad from power. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'We need to choose – if the priority is to stop the violence, as everyone says, then we need to pressure the regime and the opposition and get them to stop shooting at each other and sit down at the negotiating table,' Lavrov said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'We pressure the Syrian government – almost daily,' he added. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Both Lavrov and Hague said they would continue to press for all sides to fulfil the six-point peace plan set forward by Kofi Annan, who visited Syria on Monday. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'We are very much agreed that the Annan plan is the best hope for Syria – at the moment the only hope for Syria to try to break the cycle of violence,' Hague said. 'We are all deeply disturbed by what we've seen over the weekend.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] He said the alternatives to the Annan plan were 'ever-increasing chaos in Syria' and the descent into 'all-out civil war and collapse'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Lavrov urged all parties to redirect their efforts into ensuring the Annan plan was fulfilled. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Yet he also repeatedly accused unnamed outside powers of encouraging the Syrian opposition to keep up the violence in order to prompt outside intervention. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Although he conceded that artillery and tank shelling pointed to government involvement in the massacre at Houla, the evidence of death by close range gunshots also pointed to opposition involvement, he said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'It takes two to dance – though this seems less like a tango and more like a disco where several dozens are taking part,' he said. 'We must all act in unison.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'The problem must be solved honestly, which means we can't close our eyes to any aspect of what is happening.' He called for a thorough investigation of who was behind the violence in Houla 'so that it cannot be repeated'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The US administration has been seeking to enlist Moscow's support for a new plan that would see Assad removed from power while much of the structure of his government would remain in place, in a deal modelled on the plan that resulted in the Yemeni president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, stepping down earlier this year, the New York Times reported at the weekend. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Lavrov did not comment on the plan directly. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Russia is keenly opposed to western intervention in sovereign nations, a position it redoubled following the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in Libya, another Kremlin ally. Analysts say Russia felt duped by the west, after giving its support to a UN resolution that was phrased to support a no-fly zone but used as sanction for western intervention. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Russia approved the UN security council resolution on Libya under the presidency of Dmitry Medvedev, who has moved to the premiership since Vladimir Putin returned to the presidency earlier this month. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Putin is known as a much tougher foreign policy negotiator, and had opposed Medvedev's support for the Libya resolution. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Facing its own anti-government protests at home, the Kremlin has gone to great lengths to discredit the Syrian opposition, including on state-run television. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'We will not forget that Assad's crimes became possible because, in part, Russia did not allow the security council to take tough decisions on Syria in the spring,' Vladimir Varfolomeyev, a prominent journalist and protest supporter, wrote on Monday.

world/2011/apr/28/syria-eu-death-toll,2011-04-28,Syria: EU to respond as death toll rises,"European governments will meet on Friday to discuss imposing sanctions on Syria, responding to the repression by the Assad regime by possibly imposing travel bans and freezing the bank accounts of the president and his relatives, and of key government figures. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] It comes as pressure on the Syrian regime increased after the resignation of hundreds of members of President Bashar al-Assad's Ba'ath party in protest at the bloody crackdown, now believed to have claimed at least 500 lives. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The situation is reported to be desperate in the southern city of Deraa, where the dissent began six weeks ago. It remains under siege from tanks of the ultra-loyal Fourth Mechanised Brigade, commanded by Assad's brother, Maher, as well as, residents say, snipers and machine guns. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] With even basic supplies running out, locals said they were terrified to leave their homes. One told the Associated Press that 43 people had died in the city since the troops arrived on Monday, including a six-year-old girl shot by a sniper. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] More than 230 members of the party that has ruled Syria since 1963 announced their resignation on Wednesday night. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'Considering the breakdown of values and emblems that we were instilled with by the party, and which were destroyed at the hand of the security forces … we announce our withdrawal from the party without regret,' said 30 party members from the coastal city of Banias in a letter. About 200 members from the southern Hauran region, which includes Deraa, also stood down. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Senior officials from the 27 EU governments are to discuss sanctions on the Syrian leadership for the first time on Friday, with Britain, France, and Germany encouraging Catherine Ashton, the EU's foreign policy chief, to draw up a list of the toughest measures. While opinion will split on how to respond to the crackdown, diplomats said no one was expected to block action agreed by a majority. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The officials are to receive an intelligence briefing on the situation in Syria and are to discuss a range of options, from a mild slap on the wrist such as suspending an EU association agreement with Damascus, to more punitive measures such as a travel blacklist preventing prominent regime figures from travelling in the EU, and the freezing of bank accounts and other assets. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Figures that would be targeted would be the president's 'extended family' and other key officials in the military and security apparatus, diplomats in Brussels said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] While a tougher line is espoused by the EU's big three, Germany, France, and Britain, as well as Denmark and the Netherlands, the Austrians are said to be lukewarm on sanctions, while the Swedish foreign minister, Carl Bildt, regularly voices his scepticism on the utility of sanctions against foreign governments. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] While the international response has so far been limited to stern words and vague threats – a divided UN security council is seen as unlikely to agree on sanctions – the US has raised the stakes by specifically linking the Syrian crackdown with its main antagonist in the region, Iran. The US ambassador to the UN, Susan Rice, said Washington was 'very conscious of and concerned by the evidence of active Iranian involvement and support on behalf of the Syrian government and its repression of its people'. She refused to go into details. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] With outside media barred and many communications cut off, it has been impossible to verify the reports from Deraa. A series of residents have described dozens of corpses left in the streets and staple supplies including blood and baby formula running out. One local told Reuters: 'Anyone who gets out will find a sniper ready to shoot him. They are not sparing anyone, men, women or children.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Large numbers of Syrian women and children have crossed into northern Lebanon to escape fighting, Reuters reported. Mahmood Khazaal, former mayor of the Lebanese border town of al-Buqaya, said 1,500 people had come on foot. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Syrian human rights organisation Sawasiah said that at least 500 civilians have been killed since protests demanding political freedom and an end to corruption erupted. There were also reports of fresh shooting in the Damascus suburb of Douma. Around 90 people were arrested and scores reportedly injured after tanks rolled into Madaya, a small mountain town 25 miles north-west of the capital. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A witness told al-Jazeera he saw tanks and armoured personnel carriers surrounding Madaya, where all mobile and landline phone connections and electricity were cut from 4am until 9am. 'We don't understand why this is happening,' he said. 'There were no plans for protests today and neither had any protests been held in the city in the past two days.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] There have also been unconfirmed reports of limited dissent within the military, including soldiers from a regiment separate from the Fourth Mechanised Brigade refusing to fire on civilians in Deraa. The government denied there had been any splits in the military, which is seen as fiercely loyal to Assad. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Opposition activists in Damascus were heartened by news of the Ba'ath party resignations. 'It is only low-level but it shows that discontent is rippling through the ranks,' said one local analyst. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Although the officials have no real power, splits from the party, whose position as the leading party in state and society is enshrined in the constitution, are rare. At least 10% of Syria's population of 22 million is believed to belong to the party, which has as a long-standing power base the rural and poorer sections of society to which many protesters also belong. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Despite the increasing death toll, activists are predicting more people will take to the streets following Friday prayers, often a time for dissent. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Wissam Tarif, the executive director of human rights organisation Insan, told the Guardian: 'Youth from many cities are saying they prefer death to silence and detentions.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Wednesday 4 May 2011. We mentioned that one idea being discussed by officials was suspension of an EU association agreement with Damascus. A reader queried this, noting that Syria has yet to sign the agreement. To clarify, the story was correct: one of the penalties being considered was indeed the freezing of progress on finalising the agreement, which Brussels had earlier cleared for signature on its side.","Peter Walker, Ian Traynor in Brussels, and foreign staff",The Guardian
world/2012/dec/15/syrian-forces-rebel-damascus,2012-12-15,Syrian government forces shell rebel positions around Damascus,"Syrian warplanes bombed rebel-controlled suburbs east of Damascus on Saturday as the Syrian army fired rockets and shells at towns around the capital. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The government continued to try to dislodge rebels around Damascus who have increased their presence in the city in recent months, according to Reuters. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Jets bombarded the Beit Sahm district near the international airport and the army fired rockets at several rebel strongholds around Damascus as Nato began sending 1,200 troops to Turkey to staff and protect anti-missile batteries. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] US Admiral James Stavridis, Nato's European commander, justified the dispatch of Patriot missile batteries to Turkey by saying that the Syrian government had fired Scud missiles at rebels which had landed close to the Turkish border. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'Syria is clearly a chaotic and dangerous situation, but we have an absolute obligation to defend the borders of the alliance from any threat emanating from that troubled state,' he wrote on a US military blog. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Almost two years of fighting have caused food shortages throughout Syria with reports of long queues for bread in cities such as Aleppo and Damascus. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Walid al-Moallem, the Syrian foreign minister, blamed the suffering of his country's people on US and European sanctions as he met the head of the United Nations humanitarian organisation, Valerie Amos, in Damascus on Saturday to discuss the needs of Syrians after 21 months of conflict. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'The sanctions imposed by the United States and countries of the European Union on Syria are responsible for the suffering of the Syrian people,' Moallem said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Stavridis accused government forces on Friday of firing the Scud missiles. The Syrian government denies firing the long-range, Soviet-built rockets. However, Stavridis wrote that a handful of Scud missiles were launched inside Syria in recent days towards opposition targets and 'several landed fairly close to the Turkish border, which is very worrisome'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Turkey, a Nato member once friendly toward the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, but now among the main allies of the rebels, has complained for months of occasional artillery and gunfire across the border, some of which has caused deaths. It sought the installation of missile defences along its frontier some weeks ago. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Batteries of US-made Patriot missiles, designed to shoot down the likes of the Scuds used in the 1991 Gulf war against Saddam Hussein's Iraq, are about to be deployed by the US, German and Dutch armies, each of which is sending up to 400 troops to operate and protect the rocket systems. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Damascus has accused western powers of backing what it portrays as a Sunni Islamist 'terrorist' campaign against it and says Washington and Europe have aired concerns that Assad's forces might resort to chemical weapons solely as a pretext for preparing a possible military intervention. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In contrast to Nato's air campaign in support of Libya's successful revolt last year against Muammar Gaddafi, western powers have held back from intervention in Syria. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] They have cited the greater size and ethnic and religious complexity of a major Arab state at the heart of the Middle East – but have also lacked UN approval due to Russia's support for Assad. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] As well as the growing rebel challenge, Syria faces an alliance of Arab and western powers who stepped up diplomatic support for the rebels at a meeting in Morocco on Wednesday and warned Assad he could not win Syria's civil war. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The president's opponents have consistently underestimated his tenacity throughout the uprising, but their warnings appeared to be echoed by even his staunch ally Moscow when the Kremlin's Middle East envoy Mikhail Bogdanov conceded he might be ousted. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Russia said on Friday that Bogdanov's comments did not reflect a change in policy. France, one of the first countries to grant formal recognition to Syria's political opposition, said Moscow's continued support for Assad was perplexing. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'They risk really being on the wrong side of history. We don't see their objective reasoning that justifies them keeping this position because even the credible arguments they had don't stand up any more,' a French diplomatic source said, arguing that by remaining in power Assad was prolonging chaos and fuelling the radicalisation of Sunni Islamist rebels. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] European Union leaders who met in Brussels on Friday said all options were on the table to support the Syrian opposition, raising the possibility that non-lethal military equipment or even arms could eventually be supplied. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In their strongest statement of support for the Syrian opposition since the uprising began, EU leaders instructed their foreign ministers to assess all possibilities to increase the pressure on Assad. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] With rebels edging into the capital, a senior Nato official said Assad was likely to fall and the western military alliance should make plans to protect against the threat of his chemical arsenal falling into the wrong hands. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Desperate food shortages are growing in parts of Syria and residents of the northern city of Aleppo say fist fights and dashes across the frontlines have become part of the daily struggle to secure a loaf of bread. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Moualem told Amos that sanctions should be lifted. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The foreign minister also called on the UN to expand its relief efforts in Syria to include reconstruction 'of what has been destroyed by the armed terrorist groups', the state news agency SANA said, using a label employed by authorities to describe the rebels. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Amos said in Rome on Friday that the UN was committed to maintaining aid operations in Syria. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The World Food Programme says as many as a million Syrians may go hungry this winter, as worsening security conditions make it harder to reach conflict zones. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] At the EU summit, the British prime minister, David Cameron, pushed for an early review of the arms embargo against Syria to possibly open the way to supply equipment to rebels in the coming months. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Germany and others were more reluctant and blocked any quick move. But there was widespread agreement that whatever action can be taken under current legislation should be pursued, and the arms embargo would still be reviewed at a later stage. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'I want a very clear message to go to President Assad that nothing is off the table,' Cameron said.

The options in this paper offer alternatives for escalation and, at the same time, reasons that escalation would be costly and risky. In the end, policymakers may decide that the price for removing Asad is too high and the consequences for Syria's long-term stability too uncertain. If so, they must focus on the problem of a weakened but defiant Asad who is also more dependent on Iran.

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Amnesty has accused Nato of failing to to properly investigate or provide compensation for civilian deaths caused during its air campaign against the regime of Muammar Gaddafi. Libya. Donatella Rovera, senior crisis adviser at Amnesty said: 'Nato officials repeatedly stressed their commitment to protecting civilians. They cannot now brush aside the deaths of scores of civilians with some vague statement of regret without properly investigating these deadly incidents.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 2.10pm: Six people were killed in the clashes in Mezze, including two members of the security forces, according to British-based Rami Abdulrahman head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] He denied telling the New York Times that 18 people had been killed. The group initially said 18 members of the security forces had been injured. It has now established that two died, and 16 were injured, Abdulrahman told the Guardian. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] At least four members of an armed gang, thought to consist of army defectors from outside Damascus, were also killed, he said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Abdulrahman said the violence began when the armed group attacked the apartment of a colonel in Mezze. After the attack they fled to a nearby apartment. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] There was then a three-hour gun battle with security forces. It ended when the security forces evacuated the building and attacked the gang. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Four people from the armed or defected group were killed. The whereabouts of up to six other members of the group are unknown. 'We don't know if they are injured or arrested,' said Abdulrahman. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 1.42pm: Video has emerged purporting to show some of the damage from this morning's clashes in the Mezze district of Damascus. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The clip shows a burnt-out flat in the area with pock marked walls. Syrian state media said the clashes occurred during the raid on a 'terrorist' hide out. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claimed 18 members of the security forces were killed in the clashes, the New York Times reports. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 1.33pm: The International Committee of the Red Cross has described the Moscow meeting between its president and the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, as 'positive'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A spokesman said: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] During the meeting, the ICRC received positive indications of support on its operational priorities and on its initiative of a two-hours cessation in fighting on a daily basis. We hope to see concrete results of such meetings on the ground in the coming days/weeks. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 1.23pm: The Syrian uprising has been the subject of a number of conspiracy theories, but none as bizarre as this. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A state-owned television channel has suggested that the passing patterns of the Spanish football club Barcelona reveal weapons smuggling routes for rebel fighters, the Israeli news site Ynet reports. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In a segment aired last December on how Arab media outlets such as Al-Jazeera Al-Arabiya were 'distorting the facts,' Al Dunya TV showed a clip from a game between Barcelona and archrival Real Madrid. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The narrator claimed that Barcelona's formation represented arms smuggling routes to Syrian rebels. The players represent the smugglers, the narrator said, while the ball's position represents the current location of the weapons. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] According to the narrator, when Barcelona star Leo Messi passes the ball it indicates that the weapons have reached rebels in Deir Ezzor. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] YouTube of clip is available here. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Screengrab from Syrian TV station, al-Dunya. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 1.14pm: Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavro, has given a lukewarm response to Red Cross attempts to help it secure a ceasefire in Syria. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] At a meeting with the ICRC president, RIA Novosti quoted Lavrov as saying: 'I can tell you that we are interested in further cooperation in implementing international humanitarian law.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 12.21pm: A team of five experts sent by UN-Arab League special envoy Kofi Annan has arrived in Syria, his spokesman Ahmed Fawzi told AFP. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] There are five people with expertise in political, peacekeeping and mediation. They will be staying for as long as they are making progress (on reaching) agreement on practical steps to implement Annan's proposals. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 12.14pm: The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross has warned Russia that the humanitarian situation in Syria is likely get worse. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Reuters reports: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Jakob Kellenberger came to Moscow to ask Russia to help persuade the Syrian government to allow more access for humanitarian aid to Syrians trapped in zones of fighting. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'Our assessment, unfortunately, is that the humanitarian situation is most likely to deteriorate,' Kellenberger told Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov at the start of talks. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Kellenberger said he wanted to share the organisation's assessment and 'our convictions about what are the most urgent measures to be taken in the humanitarian field.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 12.04pm: Al-Jazeera has more on those leaked Syrian security documents. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] It says they provide an insight into President Bashar al-Assad's strategy to suppress anti-government protests, but it doesn't quote from the documents themselves. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 11.56am: Two more Syrian generals have fled to Turkey and joined rebel fighters, according to AFP citing a Turkish diplomat. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The latest defections mean a total of nine generals have deserted since the revolt against Assad's rule erupted a year ago, many of them seeking refuge in neighboring Turkey.

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] It claims authorities stormed a hideout of 'an armed terrorist group' in a residential building in the area. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Its unclear how many people died. The headline says three 'terrorists' were killed in addition to a member of the security forces. The copy says two terrorists were killed and third arrested. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 10.55am: Four people were killed in today's fighting in the Mezze district of Damascus, AP reports citing a pro-government TV station. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Ikhbariyah TV station said the clash in the western Mezze district left three 'terrorists' and a member of the security forces dead. It said one of the attackers was captured and three security troops were wounded. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Ikhbariyah said the attackers were hiding out in an apartment building before the firefight. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A resident of the western Mezze district said automatic rifles and machineguns were used in the two-hour clash that ended at about 4 am local time. 'We also heard three strong explosions,' said the man who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of government reprisal. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] He added that the clash was close to the Swiss embassy and the home of Major General Assef Shawkat, the deputy chief of staff for security affairs who is married to President Bashar Assad's sister, Bushra. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] An activist in the capital said the Monday morning clashes occurred near the political security directorate building. He said the clashes were followed with raids by security forces who were searching for the attackers. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which has a network of activists throughout Syria, said 18 of Assad's troops were wounded in the clashes. It described the clashes 'as the most violent of its kind and closest to security centers in Damascus since the revolution began.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 10.41am: Al-Jazeera is about to publish a cache of Syrian documents it claims will show the Assad regime's plans to prevent uprisings in Damascus and Aleppo.

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] (All times local - two hours ahead of GMT) [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 12.50am [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Heavy gunfire heard for almost an hour in West Mezze near the Tala Tower. All roads leading to the area were blocked by security forces. Several residents were reportedly injured [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 1.45am [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Two blasts were heard seven minutes apart. and police cars were seen heading to the area. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 2.04am [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Armed shabiha, from Mezze 86, a nearby pro-government neighbourhood, come down to West Mezze to support security forces. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 2.30am [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Security forces and shabiha force the residents of one building onto the street. Heavy gunfire is heard. Snipers are seen on the roof tops of surrounding buildings. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 2.56am - 4am [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Two more blasts were heard. A helicopter seen overhead using searchlights. More blasts follow as roads to Mezze 86 are blocked. Ambulances seen in the area. At least three people were killed and several were injured. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 4.30am [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Smoke is seen over the area as more explosions are hear. Several injured people are take to the al-Muwasah hospital. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 7.30am [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] There is intermittent gunfire as security cars roam the area. The Political Security building in the area is closed. Schools in Mezze are also shut for the day. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 9.26am: A Damascus resident told al-Jazeera of hearing several 'huge explosions' in the Mezze area this morning. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The resident, named as Omar al-Khani, also claimed there heavy gunfire and that shabiha, or armed supporters of the regime, invaded the area from higher ground. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 9.07am: An activist in Damascus claimed that this morning's clashes in the Mezze district signified a 'huge change'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'This means that the regime does not have full control of the [Mezze] area,' Lena, a spokeswoman for the Revolution Leadership Council in Damascus, told the Guardian via Skype. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] She admitted that it was difficult to establish exactly what took place, but claimed reports pointed to possible military defections in the district. Mezze is one of the most prestigious neighbourhoods in Damascus and home to embassies and high ranking officials, Lena explained. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] There were explosions, blasts. We heard that there was a clash between the regular army and the Free Syrian Army, but we are still not sure about that. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] It kept going from midnight to 6am. There were around 10 blasts. There were so many security forces there. There was a huge clash there. Around 100 injured people reached a nearby hospital. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] I heard things but I couldn't witness it myself. We have a network here. We have something like reporters in every street there. We come together on Facebook. We start talking together. 'What did you see? What did you hear?' We start gathering information and giving it to the media. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] It was [said] that the Free Syrian Army was carrying out a mission there, but we still don't know. We haven't heard anything from their part yet. But it seems that there might have been a defection in a building there - the political intelligence department. This is the why the regular army was fighting. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] This is a heavily guarded areas, so it would be very strange for [the FSA to come from outside the area]. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Lena claimed RPGs were reported to have been used causing damage to buildings. She also claimed a helicopter hover over the area using a spot light. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] As an activist Lena said she was encouraged by what appeared to have taken place, and insisted this was not wishful thinking on her part. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] This is a huge change, to hear gunfire in this prestigious place in Damascus at midnight. This is very very very different. People in Damascus know that this marks the beginning of the end. For me as an activist - I've been waiting for this for so long. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 8.32am: (all times GMT) Welcome to Middle East Live. Reports of clashes in the Mezze district of Damascus point to possible military defections. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Here's a roundup of the the latest developments: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syria [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Heavy fighting has broken out between Free Syrian Army rebels and forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad in the Mezze district of Damascus where several security installations are based. A resident told Reuters: 'There is fighting near Hamada supermarket and the sound of explosions there and elsewhere in the neighbourhood. Security police have blocked several side streets and the street lighting has been cut off.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross is due in Moscow to lobby the Russian foreign minister to try to persuade the Assad government to secure a daily ceasefire in Syria and allow humanitarian access to areas worst hit by the violence. Jakob Kellenberger said he was particularly concerned about the fate of detainees. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Syria's two biggest cities Aleppo and Damascus were hit by car bombs over the weekend as UN teams prepared to join a government-led humanitarian mission. On Saturday twin car bombs killed 27 people in the capital. A day later two more people were killed in another car bomb in Aleppo. A joint mission by the Syrian government, the United Nations and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation was due to start assessing humanitarian needs in towns across Syria which have suffered from months of unrest. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Libya [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Two British journalists who were arrested last month by a Libyan militia group and accused of spying have been released and cleared of all charges, Libya's Interior Ministry has said. Gareth Montgomery-Johnson, 36, and Nicholas Davies, 37, who work for Iran's state-owned Press TV, were arrested on 23 February by a Misrata militia based in Tripoli. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • A three-way battle for custody of Abdullah al-Senussi, the Gaddafi regime's spymaster, has broken out following his arrest over the weekend in Mauritania. Senussi is wanted for trial by Libya, France and the international criminal court in The Hague. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The Libya campaign has come at a potentially high price, making future UN-backed missions to protect civilians less likely, a report by a leading UK security thinktank has warned. The report by Royal United Services Institute released on the first anniversary of the start of Nato's Operation Odyssey Dawn, said: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] For advocates of the responsibility to protect [R2P], the worry should be that there is indeed a legacy of the Libya conflict: China and Russia will presume that the model in future operations is rather regime change under the cloak of R2P, and will be more forthcoming with vetoes. We have already seen this over Syria.

world/2012/jun/27/syrian-violence-escalates-un-conference,2012-06-27,Syrian violence escalates as UN prepares for conference,"Evidence gathered by UN investigators in Syria shows human rights violations, including executions 'on an alarming scale', according to a new report on a conflict that is spiralling into 'deeper and more destructive violence' and in which sectarian motives now predominate. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Against a background of escalating bloodshed and global concern, with gunmen killing seven on Wednesday at a pro-regime TV station near Damascus, the foreign ministers of the world's leading powers have been invited to meet in Geneva on Saturday in a desperate attempt to agree a political exit from the impasse. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] On Tuesday, president Bashar al-Assad ratcheted up his own language by describing the crisis as 'a real war' and pledged to do everything necessary to prevail. Assad had previously always blamed the uprising on 'armed terrorist gangs' backed by the west and Arab countries. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Underlining the gravity of the situation, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights described the last week as the bloodiest yet in the 16-month uprising. Observatory director Rami Abdul-Rahman said 916 people had been killed from 20 to 26 June. On Tuesday alone the reported death toll was 113, though these figures cannot be independently verified. Tank fire was reported from al-Qusair near Homs. Other attacks by government forces were reported on Wednesday in Deraa and Zamalka. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Kofi Annan, Syria envoy for the UN and the Arab League, said he had invited the five permanent members of the UN security council with Turkey and three Arab states to the Geneva conference, but there was no mention of Iran. Its presence was opposed by the US and UK, which warned they would not attend if Iran did. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Saudi Arabia, financing the fighters of the Syria Free Army, was also conspicuously left off the guest list to balance the absence of the Iranians, diplomats said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The novelty of this event will be participation by Russia and China, which have vetoed action against Assad at the UN and shunned the western-Arab Friends of Syria grouping on the grounds that it is working against the Assad regime. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] It is unclear, however, whether Moscow will accept the western view that Assad must step aside in favour of a transitional national unity government. Russia has always insisted it would not countenance regime change in Damascus. Britain's foreign secretary, Wiliam Hague, said the meeting 'must agree principles for a political transition.' Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, said she hoped it could be a 'turning point.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] If it is not, said officials in Washington and London, there will be renewed pressure to return to the security council to consider punitive measures. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Wednesday's bomb and gun assault on al-Ikhbariya TV, south of the capital, was seen as further evidence of bolder tactics by armed anti-Assad rebels. It followed an opposition attack on the elite Republican Guard on the outskirts of Damascus on Tuesday. Al-Ikbhariya is privately owned but has been a loyal mouthpiece for the regime. The attack was condemned by the Syrian government and by journalists and activists. Amnesty International said:'Even a media organisation engaged in propaganda is still a civilian object, so it and those working for it must never be deliberately targeted.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Annan's deputy, Jean-Marie Guehenno, told the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva that violence across the country now matched or surpassed levels seen before the start of the notional ceasefire on 12 April. 'Time is running out,' he warned. 'Syria is spiralling into deeper and more destructive violence.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Annan said in a statement that the new Action Group for Syria would identify steps and measures to secure full implementation of his failing six-point plan, including 'an immediate cessation of violence in all its forms.' It should, he added 'also agree on guidelines and principles for a Syrian-led political transition that meets the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people; and agree on actions that will make these objectives a reality on the ground.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Investigators for the UN Human Rights Council reported that they were unable to determine who carried out a massacre of more than 100 people in Houla near Hama in May — an event which galvanised international attention — but it said that 'forces loyal to the government may have been responsible for many of the deaths.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'As a result of the reported flow of new weapons and ammunitions both to the government forces and to the anti-government armed groups, the situation risks becoming more aggravated in the coming months,' said the report's author, Paulo Pinheiro. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syria's representative to the council, Faisal al-Hamwi, claimed there was a 'global conspiracy' against Syria. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Russian diplomat Vassily Nebenzia said rebels were carrying out daily attacks on infrastructure and killing civilians. 'Gunmen have been carrying out terrorist acts on Syrian cities. Such activities … are being fed with money and weapons from abroad,' he said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The US ambassador Eileen Chamberlain Donahoe said: 'The evidence is incontrovertible. The Assad regime is waging a brutal campaign against the Syrian people, characterised by aerial bombardment, mass killings, rape and other atrocities.'","Ian Black, Middle East editor",The Guardian
world/2012/jul/14/syria-bashar-al-assad-tremseh,2012-07-14,Syria massacre: Assad's forces 'shot anything moving',"Residents of the battered Syrian town of Tremseh have described being chased from their homes and hunted down by regime forces after seven hours of shelling during a major assault that left more than 150 people dead last Thursday. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The first observers to reach the devastated town on Saturday described widespread scenes of destruction, and many residents appeared to be too traumatised to talk about their ordeal. The massacre in the small farming community of 6,000 to the north-west of Hama is being described as the worst single atrocity of the Syrian uprising. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Two eyewitnesses from Tremseh who spoke to the Observer blamed regime forces and the pro-regime militia, the Shabiha, for the attack, which has seen many of its residents flee and left more than 100 people missing. 'We don't understand why they attacked us,' said a local woman, Umm Khaled. 'We haven't brought harm to the region. All we've done here is hold demonstrations.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Khaled, who had lived in Tremseh – a Sunni Muslim enclave – all her life, said people trying to flee through nearby fields were shot dead as they ran. She claims some of the bodies were taken away by regime forces and that others were handcuffed, then summarily executed. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syria's state news agency on Saturday released a detailed account of what it says took place in Tremseh, blaming the massacre on a 'terrorist gang' of 200 to 300 men, which it claimed included foreign Arab fighters. It released names and photographs of four men it said had been ringleaders. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The two Tremseh residents strongly denied the regime's claims that their town either supported, or had been subverted by, a terrorist group. Both insisted that the anti-regime guerrilla force, the Free Syria Army, did not have a strong presence in town. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'I swear that we don't have any terrorists, Salafists, or anyone from the outside here,' said Khaled. 'People have been terrified ever since [regime forces] came to the village in January and killed 40 of us. This time they stole from our homes, they robbed jewellery from women. All of this because we support the revolution?' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A second Tremseh resident, who wanted to be known only as Mohammed, said: 'The bombardment started at 5.30am and ended at 2pm. The incursion started at midday from the north of the village. Shabiha and regime military men entered the village and occupied the roofs of high buildings and shot at anything moving. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'They shot many civilians in the head and then burned the bodies. They handcuffed civilians and then shot them in the head. They burned shops and houses with families inside. After what happened, the FSA [Free Syrian Army] members tried to get inside the village to help with burying the martyrs and tending to the wounded but they couldn't. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'The criminals took many martyrs' bodies and wounded civilians with them and there are many missing people and burnt dead bodies with no way to identify them.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] UN monitors who entered Tremseh on Saturday said the attack appeared to have been targeted on specific groups and houses, mainly of army defectors and activists. They described seeing bullet cases and blood pooled and spattered inside homes. A school was among several buildings burned. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The UN has said that its monitors in Syria witnessed helicopters and tanks shelling Tremseh on Thursday and said the Syrian air force took a lead role in the assault. The killings appear to have similarities to the massacre that took place in Houla in late May. Tremseh, like Houla, is located near a series of Alawite villages, which have largely remained loyal to Bashar al-Assad's regime. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In a recent report on Houla, the UN said it could not say who was responsible for the massacre, which killed 108 people, but implied that regime forces and their backers had played a role. The two Tremseh witnesses who spoke to the Observer claimed that some of their attackers came from the direction of Alawite villages, which they named as Safsafeyeh, Tal Sikeen and Falha. 'Relations between us and the Alawite villages were always peaceful but some of the Shabiha did come from there,' said Mohammed. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Umm Khaled said: 'We had no problems with them for a long time, but now we fear them. We don't want to go near their villages.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The spectre of sectarian war is looming over the Syrian uprising, which is being led by the country's Sunni majority. While Assad retains support from within the Sunni establishment, particularly the merchant class, there are signs that his Sunni backing is beginning to ebb. In the past fortnight a leading Sunni brigadier general and family friend of the Assads, Manaf Tlass as well as Syria's ambassador to Iraq have defected. Assad's support among the Alawite sect, from which the regime has historically drawn its key members, is thought to remain solid. Sections of Syria's minority communities, including Christians, Druze and Kurds, are increasingly threatened by the uprising, which they believe has strong Islamist undertones.

world/2011/apr/28/syria-hundreds-resign-baath-party,2011-04-28,Syria crackdown: hundreds resign from Ba'ath party,"Hundreds of President Bashar al-Assad's ruling Ba'ath party have resigned in protest at an increasingly bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters that is believed to have claimed at least 500 lives. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] News of the resignations emerged as a deeply divided UN security council failed to agree on a European and US-backed statement condemning the government's use of violence. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The draft – proposed by France, Britain, Germany and Portugal – was opposed by several within the 15-member security council, including Russia, Lebanon and India. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Alexander Pankin, Russia's ambassador to the UN, warned that a 'real threat to regional security could arise from outside interference in Syria's domestic situation'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] France, Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain summoned Syrian ambassadors in their countries to tell them they condemned the violence and said Assad must change tactics. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In a potential embarrassment for the British government, it emerged that Sami Khiyami, the Syrian ambassador to London, was still on the guest list for the royal wedding. The Foreign Office later announced that it had decided, with the agreement of Buckingham Palace, that the presence of the ambassador would be 'unacceptable' and that he should not attend. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Meanwhile, the University of St Andrews, where Prince William and Kate Middleton studied, has announced it is to review the financing of one of its Syrian studies centres after the Guardian revealed that funding was arranged with Khiyami's help. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syrian human rights organisation Sawasiah said on Thursday that at least 500 civilians have been killed in the protests. Sawasiah, which was founded by jailed Syrian human rights lawyer Muhannad al-Hassani, also said thousands of Syrians have been arrested and scores have gone missing after demonstrations demanding political freedom and an end to corruption erupted almost six weeks ago. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syria's UN ambassador, Bashar Ja'afari, welcomed the UN's inaction, and blamed the violence on 'extremist groups'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] But while the international community failed to condemn the violence, signs of dissent within government ranks started to grow as more than 230 members of the monolithic party that has ruled Syria since 1963 announced their resignation. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'Considering the breakdown of values and emblems that we were instilled with by the party and which were destroyed at the hand of the security forces … we announce our withdrawal from the party without regret,' 30 party members from the coastal city of Banias said in a letter. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] They accused security forces and pro-government gunmen of opening fire at homes, mosques and churches and inciting sectarian strife between the country's Sunni majority and President Assad's minority Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shia Islam. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The city – which sits near the Alawite's mountain heartland – has seen repeated street protests, which have been met with gunfire, raids and mass arrests by the security forces. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] About 200 members from the southern Hauran region – which includes the besieged city of Deraa – also stood down, citing the Ba'ath party leadership's complicity with 'crimes of the Syrian intelligence agencies'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Deraa, where protests against the Assad regime began six weeks ago, has been surrounded by troops for days, and residents are reportedly running out of food, water and medicine. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Gunfire and sporadic explosions were heard in the city on Wednesday night, after dozens of tanks were seen heading to the city. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'We have no electricity, no water, no telephones and no bread,' resident Abdullah Abazeid told the Associated Press by satellite telephone. 'The situation is terrible.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Bodies of protesters killed by security forces are reportedly being stored in refrigerated trucks, and residents reported that snipers were firing at people in the streets. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] On Monday, the ultra-loyal Fourth Mechanised Division, commanded by Assad's brother Maher, were dispatched to the city. Reports from opposition figures and Deraa residents, which could not be confirmed, said several soldiers from another unit had refused to fire on civilians. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Some residents said at least five army officers had sided with demonstrators, and conscripted soldiers sent into the city were quietly refusing orders to detain people at checkpoints and were allowing some people through to get scarce supplies. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] One diplomat told Reuters there had been at least one instance this month of soldiers confronting secret police to stop them shooting at protesters. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'No one is saying that Assad is about to lose control of the army, but once you start using the army to slaughter your own people, it is a sign of weakness,' he said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] But the Syrian government denied there had been any splits in the military, which is seen as fiercely loyal to Assad. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In Damascus, news of the UN's failure to condemn the crackdown was met with resigned disappointment, but activists have been heartened by news of the resignations. 'It is only low-level but it shows that discontent is rippling through the ranks,' said one local analyst. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Although the officials have no real power, splits from the party, whose position as the leading party in state and society is enshrined in article 8 of the constitution, are rare. At least 10% of the 22 million population are believed to belong to the party, whose traditional power base was among the rural and poorer sectors of society to which many of the protesters belong. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Activists have been angered by the muted response of their Arab neighbours and had been hoping for a stronger international response. They have called for sanctions, travel bans and the freezing of assets – but are adamantly opposed to military intervention. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Both pro- and anti-regime camps have vowed to turn out in large numbers on Friday.

world/2012/jul/21/syrians-flee-fierce-fighting-aleppo,2012-07-21,Syrians flee fierce fighting in Aleppo,"Fierce fighting erupted on Saturday in Syria's historic northern city of Aleppo, with thousands of residents forced to flee amid bloody clashes between resurgent Free Syrian Army fighters and government troops. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Activists posted video showing residents fleeing Aleppo in cars and minibuses early on Saturday, after the authorities warned that they would shell rebel-controlled districts. Most of the fighting was in the Salaheddin part of the city, they said, where FSA fighters were massing. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Aleppo, Syria's second largest city, is dominated by Sunni Muslims, but has a minority population of Christians of various denominations. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] It had so far largely escaped the country's 16-month conflict, which has recently become a fast-changing guerrilla war between opposition fighters and the Syrian army, which has heavy weapons. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The battle in Aleppo comes after a devastating week for the president, Bashar al-Assad, with fighting in the heart of the capital, Damascus; a bomb attack that killed four members of his military-security command; and predictions that his regime was entering its final weeks or months. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Assad's forces continue to control key cities, at least during the day, but have lost much of the rural hinterland. The FSA has been able to capture a series of border posts with Turkey and Iraq, further puncturing the regime's authority, and is now controlling large areas of the northern and eastern periphery. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The FSA had previously reached within nine miles of Aleppo. On Saturday activist Mohammad Saeed said that dozens of FSA rebels had penetrated deep inside the city. There were reports that they had set up checkpoints in some areas. Video showed thick black smoke billowing over buildings. Some residents had painted walls with the pre-Baathist flag, the symbol of the revolution. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In a further sign of rapid regime erosion, four more army brigadiers were said to have crossed into Turkey, bringing the number of senior military defectors there to about 100. Another brigadier, Adelnasser Ferzat, defected to FSA fighters in Aleppo, it was claimed. In a video address in fluent Russian, he urges Moscow to dump Assad and back 'freedom' and the rebels' side. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Activists said that as many as 7,000 Aleppo residents have fled to safety. Last week's surge in violence has trapped millions of Syrians, with several areas of Damascus now deserted, and tens of thousands of refugees flooding into neighbouring Lebanon. Some 30,000 Syrians – many of them affluent – crossed the border into Lebanon on Thursday and Friday. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Diplomatic efforts to solve the crisis have been largely overtaken by events, despite a vote in the UN security council late on Thursday to extend the UN's monitoring mission for 30 days. The international community remains divided. Iran, Russia and China steadfastly support the Assad regime; Saudi Arabia and Qatar are overtly aiding the rebels; Britain, the US and the EU are calling for a 'political transition' and Assad's immediate departure. Meanwhile, Israel, the region's most formidable military power, announced that it would consider action to prevent Syria's chemical weapons and missiles arsenal from falling into the hands of Hezbollah, Assad's Shia Islamist allies in neighbouring Lebanon. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Israel's defence minister, Ehud Barak, said: 'I have instructed the military to increase its intelligence preparations and prepare what is needed so that ... [if necessary] ... we will be able to consider carrying out an operation.'

world/middle-east-live/2012/sep/07/syria-crisis-eu-talks-live,2012-09-07,Syria crisis: bombs and shelling hit Damascus - Friday 7 September 2012,"5.04pm BST [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Summary [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Here's a summary of the latest developments: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syria [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The head of the criminal security branch in Damascus was one of two senior figures to announce his defection from the Assad regime over the last 24 hours. Speaking after fleeing to Turkey, Awad Ahmed al-Ali, said the Syrian government had lost legitimacy after the 'malicious and vicious' killing of civilians. Syria's attaché to Serbia, Bashar Al-Haj Ali, also announced his defection in an interview to al-Jazeera Arabic. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Six people – including five security personnel – were killed and several others wounded in a 'terrorist' blast caused by explosives attached to a motorcycle in the Rukn al-Din district of Damascus, state television said. A car bomb also exploded between the information ministry and the main Damascus courthouse. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The UNHCR and the European Commission have announced an increase in emergency aid to those fleeing the violence in Syria. The move came as the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross, described his shock at the level of destruction he witnessed this week on a three-day visit to Syria. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The Free Syrian Army has denied reports that it intends to start treating civilian airports as 'legitimate targets'. The officer who claimed civilian airlines would be targeted has been dismissed, a deputy commander of the FSA told the Guardian. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • EU foreign ministers are meeting in Cyprus to discuss ways of helping the Syrian opposition and tackle the worsening humanitarian crisis, AFP reports. Britain's foreign secretary William Hague underlined that EU countries can only provide non-lethal aid to the Syrian opposition. He pointed out that the EU arms embargo renders the supply of any weapons illegal. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • At least 20 people were killed when the Syrian army shelled the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp in southern Damascus, Reuters reports citing residents and local emergency workers. Yarmouk camp and the districts surrounding it have seen the most prolonged fighting in the capital since forces loyal to the Assad regime launched a counter-offensive to push rebels out of the city two months ago. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Iran's president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has personally authorised the deployment of 150 senior Revolutionary Guards commanders to Syria, the Telegraph reports citing western intelligence officials. It claimed the move is part of an increase support, including weapons shipments, made after the assassination of four of Bashar al-Assad's inner circle in July. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Bahrain [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Anti-government protests have been taking place in Bahrain. However, a heavy security presence is said to have restricted the scale of the demonstrations which were called in response to a court's decision to uphold life prison sentences against several leading opposition activists. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The UN's human rights chief, Navi Pillay, has added her voice to the chorus of international condemnation at the court's decision. She said: 'None of the courts so far adequately addressed the defendants’ allegations that they were tortured in detention and forced to make confessions under duress.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 4.29pm BST [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Canada severs diplomatic ties with Iran [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Canada has closed its embassy in Tehran and ordered the expulsion of Iranian diplomats from Ottawa, Saeed Kamali Dehghan writes. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Canadian foreign affairs minister John Baird cited Iran's support for Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria, its disputed nuclear programme and continued human rights violations as reasons behind his country's move. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'The Iranian regime is providing increasing military assistance to the Assad regime; it refuses to comply with UN resolutions pertaining to its nuclear programme; it routinely threatens the existence of Israel and engages in racist anti-Semitic rhetoric and incitement to genocide,' Baird said in a statement published on a Canadian government website. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 4.11pm BST [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Life and death in Yarmouk camp [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The growing number of refugees fleeing Syria to neighbouring countries has been causing concern this week. But there are also many more internally displaced persons (IDPs) who have fled their homes but remained in Syria. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In Damascus, the Yarmouk camp – normally home to about 500,000 Palestinian refugees – is now also home to about 140,000 displaced Syrians. This is far larger than the number of Syrian refugees in Turkey or Jordan, for example. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Palestinians in the camp who have been treated as guests in Syria since being forced to leave their homeland say they have a duty to return the favour for homeless Syrians. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Our colleague Mona Mahmood has been talking on the phone to a 35-year-old Palestinian resident of the camp who was born in Syria and gave his name as Adnan Rizeq. This is how he described the situation. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Since the Syrian refugees [IDPs] started to come to Yarmouk camp, many Palestinian men volunteered to form committees to deal with the refugees. They have listed their names and places. These volunteers are in charge of collecting donations from the rich Palestinian businessmen in the camp as well as any donations offered by the Palestinian families. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] They are organising food parcels to distribute among the refugees either weekly or monthly. Palestinian people are ready to share food and everything with Syrian people – we have been their guests for long and this is our turn to help them. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Forty thousand Syrian people are in schools and mosques and 100,000 of them are sharing flats with the Palestinians inside the camp. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Syrian regime issued a deadline two weeks ago to all refugees who are in the schools to evacuate them before last Friday or the regime will take other procedures. We refused to obey to this order in the camp and the Syrian refugees will stay in the schools. No one will ask them to leave, even if the schools start soon. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] All the entrances [to the camp] from restive areas are sealed off by the Syrian army only the main road is left open. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Food is so expensive, and food or medications brought inside have to be checked by the Syrian army – they will think that you are taking the food to the FSA. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] I used to work few months ago distributing food to schools where the refugees are, but the Syrian army gave me hard time till I stopped completely. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The humanitarian situation in the camp is miserable. Chances of work in the camp are nil. I myself do not have a job. Some of the people were working in construction, but who cares to build a house now? People want to save money rather than build houses. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We want the UN to shoulder its responsibility towards the camp. The UN did not offer any aid since the start of the revolution. Before, they used to give food and free medical treatment but no more now, neither the Red Cross of the Red Crescent – only the Palestinian Red Crescent is helping us. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] I do not want to say that Yarmouk camp has declared mutiny against the regime but the Syrian regime is provoking the Palestinians. We decided to declare Yarmouk camp as a quiet shelter for refugees only. We have asked all the FSA brigades in areas nearby not to come inside the camp. We want the camp to stay away from political turmoil and avoid any clashes with the regime. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] [But] we are living in a real state of fear. This is a very crowded place and any shell, wherever it falls, will kill people [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Today at 12.30pm, four mortar shells fell on Yarmouk camp from Palestine Street. They fell on houses full of people near the entrance of the camp. Two people were martyred and 10 others wounded. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 4.08pm BST [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Austin Tice banners in Yabroud [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Protesters in Yabroud, north-east of Damascus, held banners in support of the missing US photojournalist Austin Tice. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Tice went missing more than three weeks ago. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Liz Sly, of the Washington Post, tweeted these images of the banners.

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syrian forces bombarded a crowded Palestinian refugee district in Damascus, killing at least 10 people according to residents, while other parts of the city were rocked by apparent rebel bomb attacks. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Five security personnel were killed and several others were wounded in a 'terrorist' blast caused by explosives attached to a motorcycle in the Rukn al-Din district of Damascus, state television said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A car bomb also exploded between the information ministry and the main Damascus courthouse, it said, giving no details of any casualties. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In the south of the capital, rockets rained down on Yarmouk, a densely populated Palestinian refugee camp. A woman living nearby counted at least 11 strikes. Video uploaded by activists showed clouds of grey smoke curling into the air. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'At least 10 people have been killed and 15 wounded since they resumed shelling,' the woman said by telephone, asking not to be named for her own safety. 'There are several burned corpses and limbs, so no one is sure of the total death toll.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Residents across the city said they had been hearing heavy blasts and sporadic gunfire since early on Friday morning. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'I can count at least 10 columns of smoke coming from the southern neighbourhoods around the camp,' said activist Samir al-Shami, speaking on Skype. He said tanks and troops had been brought in to conduct raids on some southern neighbourhoods. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Assad's forces are trying to re-establish full control in Damascus as they battle anti-government forces in Aleppo, Syrias economic hub, and pockets of rebellion across the country. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The army began bombarding Yarmouk on Thursday, possibly targeting rebels who residents say may have entered the camp. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'Why are they doing this? What good is shelling a camp with houses and bakeries? They are making sure that every Syrian and Palestinian turns against them,' complained one Palestinian resident near Yarmouk, who also asked to remain anonymous. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Palestinians have been divided over whether or not to support Assad, but there are signs that more and more are now starting to back the uprising. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 3.25pm BST [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] EU can provide only non-lethal support [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Britain's foreign secretary William Hague underlined that EU countries can only provide non-lethal aid to Syrian opposition. Speaking at a meeting of EU foreign minister in Cyprus he pointed out the EU arms embargoed that renders the supply of any weapons illegal, according to Reuters. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'At the moment we have a European Union arms embargo on Syria, it's not possible or legal for any EU nation to send weapons to anybody in Syria and therefore our chosen route and is the same route of France and the United States, is to give non-lethal assistance and we're doing that,' Hague told reporters. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] He said Britain is also mulling sending protective clothing that doesn't fall under the arms ban. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Hague also said that he would like to see the EU designate Hezbollah's military wing as a terrorist organization and to impose sanctions on the group. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton told reporters that the EU continues to be 'extremely worried and concerned' over the suffering of Syrians fleeing the conflict. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] She said that she is working closely with the new UN Arab League envoy to Syria, Lakhdar Brahimi, and is in touch with officials in the region including Arab League chief Nabil al-Arabi. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Ashton urged the Syrian opposition, which has fought to topple Assad's regime for the last 18 months, to 'come together and find a way in with they can represent all the country's people'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'Any weapon used against the people of Syria by those who pretend to be the government of Syria is outrageous and we need to be very clear that we want to see this violence stop and the understanding has to be reached that they cannot stay there,' said Ashton. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Updated at 4.35pm BST [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 3.06pm BST [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Bombardment of Yarmouk, Damascus [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Whole neighbourhoods have been destroyed in the last 24 hours in the bombardment of the Yarmouk Palestinian camp, according to an activist in the area. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Speaking to the Guardian, Mahmoud Nasar, said: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Since last night Yarmouk has become a target for Syria military rockets. They bombed Yarmouk from Qassum mountain. There are a lot of casualties because it was a civilian neighbourhood that was bombed. We have the names of ten people who died, and around 70 or 75 wounded. All of them are civilians. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In a call interrupted by the sound of a shell landing, he added: 'We have never seen shelling like this before. They used very big mortars. I saw one of the explosions, it was very very strong. A building with two floors came down.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Nasar speculated that the government was trying to clear the area to attack Free Syrian Army positons in neighbouring districts. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] I can assure your that there are no Free Syrian Army soldiers in Yarmouk. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The regime targeted Yarmouk to send a message to the Palestinian refugees and Syrians that there is no safe place - and we can get you where ever you are. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Today about 25 bombs have landed on Yarmouk and have destroyed whole neighbourhoods. They bombed Ja'ouneh Street [scene of shelling of last month]. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We think the regime wants to clear this neighbourhood between Yarmouk and Tadamon [to the north-east]. We are talking about 1km [square], because the Free Syrian Army is very strong in Tadamon and Hajar al-Aswad [to the south see map bellow]. They want to use Yarmouk. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] When the bombs and rockets came down all the houses in Yarmouk shook.

It is said to have been filmed at Abu Dhuhur, an exclusively military airbase near Idlib, and an aircraft clearly marked in the livery of the Syrian national airline can be seen parked there. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The aircraft is believed to be an Ilyushin 76. The airline has four of them which it says provide 'commercial cargo services'. According to Wikipedia, it was designed 'especially for outsized or heavy items unable to be otherwise carried'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Syria Survey blog suggests the regime is increasingly turning to civilian planes to transport supplies around the country: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The ability to transport supplies and carry out attacks from the air has become increasingly important for the regime as rebel IEDs make travel by land arduous. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] However, the use of civilian Ilyushins is not new. The Aviationist blog noted one at an airbase in Hama last March.

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Orwa Nyrabia, director of the Damascus-based international documentary festival DoxBox, travelled to the Syrian capital on 23 August to catch a flight to Cairo. His family lost contact with him shortly after he arrived at the airport, and Egyptian authorities say he did not board the plane, indicating that he had been arrested by the Syrian authorities. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A letter signed by 51 directors, producers, writers and actors says no information has been forthcoming about where Nyrabia is being held, which security branch is holding him or why he has been detained. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'We, the undersigned members of the UK film community and international friends, implore the Syrian authorities to release Orwa Nyrabia immediately,' reads the letter, which also counts David Puttnam, Mike Leigh, Ken Loach and Colin Firth among its signatories.

Speaking after fleeing to Turkey, Awad Ahmed al-Ali, said the Syrian government had lost legitimacy after the 'malicious and vicious' killing of civilians. Syria's attaché to Serbia, Bashar Al-Haj Ali, also announced his defection in an interview to al-Jazeera Arabic. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The UNHCR and the European Commission have announced an increase in emergency aid to those fleeing the violence in Syria. The move came as the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross, described his shock at the level of destruction he witnessed this week on a three-day visit to Syria. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The Free Syrian Army has denied reports that it intends to start treating civilian airports as 'legitimate targets'. The officer who claimed civilian airlines would be targeted has been dismissed, a deputy commander of the FSA told the Guardian. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • EU foreign ministers are meeting in Cyprus to discuss ways of helping the Syrian opposition and tackle the worsening humanitarian crisis, AFP reports. European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton put Syria top of the agenda for two days of informal talks. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • At least 20 people were killed when the Syrian army shelled the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp in southern Damascus, Reuters reports citing residents and local emergency workers. Yarmouk camp and the districts surrounding it have seen the most prolonged fighting in the capital since forces loyal to the Assad regime launched a counter-offensive to push rebels out of the city two months ago. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Iran's president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has personally authorised the deployment of 150 senior Revolutionary Guards commanders to Syria, the Telegraph reports citing Western intelligence officials. It claimed the move is part of an increase support, including weapons shipments, made after the assassination of four of Bashar al-Assad's inner circle in July. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Bahrain [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Pro-democracy protesters are heading for a confrontation with the security forces after going ahead with a banned rally today. The rally is being held in response to a court's decision to uphold life prison sentences against several leading opposition activists. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The UN's human rights chief, Navi Pillay, has added her voice to the chorus of international condemnation at the court's decision. She said: 'None of the courts so far adequately addressed the defendants’ allegations that they were tortured in detention and forced to make confessions under duress.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Updated at 12.20pm BST [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 12.04pm BST [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] FSA 'will not attack civil airports' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The FSA has dissociated itself from reports that it intends to start treating the airports of Damascus and Aleppo as 'legitimate targets'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Remarks threatening civilian airports have been attributed to Bassam Dada, who is described in the reports as a political adviser to the FSA. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] However, Malik Kurdi, deputy commander of the FSA, has told the Guardian that Bassam Dada was relieved of his post a month ago. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Kurdi was speaking in a telephone conversation with our colleague Mona Mahmood. He continued: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Civil planes are not a target for the FSA, but we have a problem that some of the warplanes take off from civil airports to target the FSA and civilians. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We will attack these warplanes wherever they are, but not inside civil airports. We are worried a mistake might happen – civil planes might be hit as well as passengers. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We hope that the passengers will not take any civil flights because the regime might use a trick to deceive public opinion by attacking one of the civil planes and blaming the FSA. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We totally confirm that we will never attack civil airports and cause harm to civilians. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] You have to know that inside any civil airport in Syria there is a military airport – like Damascus airport and Latakia airport. We cannot by any means target these civil airports but we will be watching warplanes as they take off from these airports and try to target them soon after they get out of the airport. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We can attack these planes inside the airport in one situation only which is to get control of all the areas surrounding the airport by liberating them, then evacuate the airport and the surrounding areas of people and then to attack them to avoid causing harm to civilians. But this idea seems impossible now and impractical, so we will not do that.

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The European Commission has announced an extra €50m (£40m) worth of emergency aid. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Kristalina Georgieva, commissioner responsible for humanitarian aid, said: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The humanitarian situation in Syria is worsening almost daily now that the hostilities have slipped into civil war. There are already tens of thousands of Syrian refugees in Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and Iraq. This calls for massive and effective humanitarian aid to reach those in urgent need of medical supplies and items such as baby food. This is why we are stepping up our assistance in this desperate situation. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The UN's refugee agency said it was doubling its budget to $41.7m (£26m). [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Spokesman Adrian Edwards said: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The help we are seeking includes for household items, financial assistance for 200,000 people considered vulnerable, medical assistance, counselling of displaced populations, rehabilitation of shelters and support to encourage refugee and displaced Syrian children to return to school. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 10.57am BST [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Red Cross chief shocked by destruction in Syria [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Peter Maurer, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, has described his shock at the level of destruction he witnessed this week on a three-day visit to Syria. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Maurer also revealed that he requested access to prisoners during his meeting with Bashar al-Assad. He said he was given positive assurances on the issue and the need for humanitarian aid to the worst hit areas. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In a diplomatically-worded statement Maurer said: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Since the conflict erupted there have been many casualties, and now the situation is rapidly deteriorating even further. President al-Assad agreed on the necessity of urgently boosting humanitarian aid by making it easier to bring in goods that would enable us to step up our activities and adequately respond to the needs that have been growing with gathering speed. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] I also discussed with President al-Assad our outstanding request to visit all persons detained in Syria in connection with the current events – persons held in all facilities, including those managed by the security authorities and those used for interrogation. President al-Assad expressed his readiness to address this issue. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Since March 2011, tens of thousands of people have been detained in the country. Their basic rights must be upheld and they must be able to get in touch with their families. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The positive commitments I received during my meetings will obviously have to be followed up and tested in the coming weeks. Each day that passes brings more casualties and human suffering. I will personally pay the closest attention to how the outcome of our discussions materializes on the ground. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The rules of international humanitarian law must be adhered to by all parties to the conflict to avoid civilian loss of life. It is the responsibility of the parties to protect civilians in their conduct of hostilities.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The agency is tweeting updates from Maurer's press conference.

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Pillay said: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Given the gravity of the charges, the scant evidence available beyond confessions, the serious allegations of torture and the irregularities in the trial processes, it is extremely disappointing that the convictions and sentences have been upheld in appeals proceedings that often took place behind closed doors. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] None of the courts so far adequately addressed the defendants’ allegations that they were tortured in detention and forced to make confessions under duress. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 10.31am BST [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Canadian diplomat to head Damascus office [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Canadian diplomat Mokhtar Lamani will head the Damascus office for the Lakhdar Brahimi, the new UN Arab League envoy to Syria, AP reports. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Lamani, a Canadian national of Moroccan origin, served as a special Arab League envoy to Iraq. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 10.12am BST [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Bahrain blogger's conviction condemned [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Committee to Protect Journalists has called on the Bahraini authorities to throw out the conviction Abduljalil Alsingace, a prominent blogger and human rights activist, whose life sentence on charges of 'plotting to topple' the regime was confirmed by an appeal court earlier this week. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The court also upheld a 15-year jail term against Ali Abdel Imam, an online journalist who had been convicted in absentia, along with the convictions of 17 others. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Imam was detained in September 2010 after being summoned for questioning by the National Security Apparatus and the news website he had established in 1999, BahrainOnline, was shut down, the CPJ says. His arrest came amid a government crackdown on opposition activists ahead of parliamentary elections. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Alsingace, a blogger and active member in the Haq Movement for Civil Liberties and Democracy, was arrested in August 2010 at Bahrain airport when returning from a visit in London, where he had spoken critically about human rights violations in Bahrain. Before his detention, Alsingace regularly published articles critical of the government's record, particularly with regard to rights of the kingdom's Shia majority. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Both were said to have abused 'the freedom of opinion and expression prevailing in the kingdom'. They were later released under a royal amnesty but rearrested in March 2011.

Syria has hit back at prime minster Recep Tayyip Erdogan after he accused Assad of creating a terrorist state. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syria's foreign ministry described Erdogan's remarks as 'impudent', according to state news agency Sana. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In a statement it said: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Erdogan accuses Syria of terrorism while he and his government practice this terrorism overtly against the Syrian people through harbouring, training and supporting the armed terrorist groups, in addition to facilitating the infiltration of terrorists and Jihadists to Syria [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 9.44am BST [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Senior defection [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Al-Arabiya has broadcast footage of a senior member of Assad's security forces announcing his defection.

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Analysts and opposition activists said not enough was being offered. The amounts are 'laughable' according to Ausama Monajed, spokesman for the Syrian National Council. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Peter Harling, of the thinktank International Crisis Group, said Syria's opposition, although divided, was more than capable of handling aid. He criticized European and American diplomatic hesitancy as 'a tendency to posture, to make statements as opposed to actual policy-making.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Harling said words without action would have long-term consequences among Syrians: 'There's a huge disconnect which is causing a lot of frustration and will cause ultimately hostility on the part of Syrians who hear a lot of empty statements but see very little happening on the ground.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 8.55am BST [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Summary [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Welcome to Middle East Live. Here's a summary of the latest developments: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syria [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • EU foreign ministers are meeting in Cyprus to discuss ways of helping the Syrian opposition and tackle the worsening humanitarian crisis, AFP reports. European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton put Syria top of the agenda for two days of informal talks. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Syria's attaché to Serbia, Bashar Al-Haj Ali, has announced his defection in an interview to al-Jazeera Arabic. He apologised for not defecting sooner, it said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • At least 20 people were killed when the Syrian army shelled the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp in southern Damascus, Reuters reports citing residents and local emergency workers. Yarmouk camp and the districts surrounding it have seen the most prolonged fighting in the capital since forces loyal to the Assad regime launched a counter-offensive to push rebels out of the city two months ago. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • David Cameron and French president François Hollande agreed on the need to speed up the political transition in Syria, after meeting at the Olympic Park in London. Holland reiterated his promise to recognise a provisional Syrian government so long as the Syrian opposition form one that is inclusive and representative. Cameron and his advisers still think it is premature to recognise an opposition that remains divided and unable to solve differences between external and internal opposition groups. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Rebels have assassinated a leader of the Jihadi group Jubhat al-Nusra, an al-Qaida affiliate, the New York Times reports. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The fighter, Abu Mohamed al-Shami Abu al-Absi, led a brigade known as Jubhat al-Nusra, which calls itself a Qaeda affiliate. His body was found Wednesday in an area known as Sarmada on the Turkish border, several rebel fighters said in interviews over the Internet. All said he had disappeared three days earlier and was evidently kidnapped and assassinated. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Iran's president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has personally authorised the deployment of 150 senior Revolutionary Guards commanders to Syria, the Telegraph reports citing Western intelligence officials.

Ghannouchi said Syria's false claim was prompted by Tunisian support for the Syrian uprising, Tunisia Live reports. Can you really sue a paper because an official quoted gave an maliciously inaccurate statement? asks the Arabist. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Libya [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Libya has said it will delay the trial of Muammar Gaddafi's son Saif al-Islam, to gather evidence against him from the former spy chief Abdullah al-Senussi who was extradited to Tripoli on Wednesday. 'We expect the trial of Saif al-Islam to be delayed a little because Abdullah Senussi will be able to provide new information that can be used in Saif's trial,' said prosecution spokesman Taha Ba'ara.

world/2012/may/26/syria-houla-military-assault-children,2012-05-26,Massacre of the children as Syrian forces hit rebels,"Syria's fragile peace process is in shreds after what was claimed to be a regime-backed massacre left 32 children among more than 90 dead and triggered a wave of international revulsion. As UN observers in the central town of Houla confirmed one of the bloodiest death tolls of the 15-month revolt against President Bashar al-Assad, rebels said they were on the brink of abandoning a negotiated plan to end the conflict. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Videos uploaded to the internet and purporting to be from Houla show many dead and badly mutilated infants. Residents say some victims were killed with knives, while many more died from 18 hours of relentless shelling that left buildings wrecked and homes destroyed in a large residential area near the centre of town. Major General Robert Mood, head of the UN team in Syria, deplored the attack, which began at midday on Friday, as 'indiscriminate and unforgivable' but did not say who had been to blame. Syrian state television blamed 'terrorist gangs'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] As calls mounted for international intervention, a peace plan negotiated in March by the former UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, appeared to be in ruins. Yesterday the main opposition Free Syrian Army, which, like regime troops had failed to abide by Annan's terms, told the TV station al-Jazeera that unless civilian safety could be guaranteed, the plan was 'going to hell'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The foreign secretary, William Hague, said Britain would co-ordinate a 'strong response' to the massacre. 'Our urgent priority is to establish a full account of this appalling crime and to move swiftly to ensure that those responsible are identified and held to account,' he said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The international community was united in its condemnation. UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon said the killings were a 'flagrant violation of international law' while the White House called the violence acts of 'unspeakable and inhuman brutality.' Arab League head Nabil Elaraby said the killings were a 'horrific crime' and urged UN action. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Save the Children's chief executive, Justin Forsyth, echoed calls for intervention. He said: 'This indiscriminate killing must stop now. The world cannot sit back and allow this to happen. Children are suffering terribly in this conflict.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Annan is due back in Damascus imminently to discuss the ongoing crisis with key officials. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Ban Ki-moon has warned there is no plan B for the situation, which poses an increasingly grave risk to regional security. Despite the chaos, UN monitors have moved widely around the country and witnessed shootings or explosions almost everywhere they have visited. In some instances, UN convoys have been targeted themselves. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The regime has touted such attacks as evidence of al-Qaida at work, while the Free Syria Army has vehemently insisted that the regime itself has been concocting the attacks in a bid to reinforce its narrative. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'Everywhere [the UN monitors] go, something happens to them,' Moustafa Abdul Salam told the Observer in the northern Syrian village of Sarji. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'They want to terrorise them into submission and make them doubt their own instincts. Already you have the Americans saying that al-Qaida might be at work here, so that means the regime are winning. And when they feel that way they will behave even more like savages.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Saturday's UN visit to Houla seemed to be going to script. Monitors, who arrived at about midday, were slow to engage with locals angrily remonstrating at a distance. UN officials also tried to visit Qusair south of Homs. Residents angrily claimed they had turned back for Damascus after gunfire erupted. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'This is the third time they have come here and fled,' said one man contacted by Skype. 'We know what happens to us if we can ever speak to one of them and they fear that the regime will attack them too.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The uprising has led to a steady unwinding of stability in the iron-clad police state coupled with a sharp rise in violence, especially since opposition groups took up arms in large numbers last August. The Free Syria Army now controls pockets of the country. Though severely under-equipped, it has the capacity to launch hit-and-run attacks against regime forces. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Opposition fighters claimed to have launched reprisal attacks in four areas of the country in the wake of the Houla attack. However, they complain that the severing of their supply lines to Lebanon will sharply limit their ability to hold the ground they now control. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Lebanon, which has been under the tutelage of Syria for much of the past 35 years, has seen an increase in sectarian tension in the past week, which is being directly linked to the crisis shaking its larger neighbour. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Last Sunday, Sunni sheikh Ahmed Abdul Wahid, a key supporter of the Syrian opposition, was killed by a Lebanese soldier at a checkpoint, leading to clashes in mixed areas of Beirut. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Events took a new twist on Wednesday when Lebanese soldiers in the heart of west Beirut were involved in a shoot-out with what officials described as a terrorist cell which it said had been trying to draw a pro-Syrian political headquarters located nearby into a firefight. Two of the men killed in the seven-hour gun battle were identified as Islamic extremists who had been freed from a Lebanese jail in November. Syria also released a large number of alleged militant Islamists from its key security prison around the same time. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'Things are never as they seem here,' said a senior Lebanese member of parliament. 'Al-Qaida in Beirut very much fits the storyline for Syria itself and the pro-Syrian parties in Lebanon.' If the Assad regime let these people out of prison, they must have had a use for them — even an unwitting one.

world/2011/apr/22/syria-protests-forces-shoot,2011-04-22,Syrian troops shoot dead protesters in day of turmoil,"Syria endured its bloodiest day yet of the Arab Spring as protests against President Bashar al-Assad brought turmoil to dozens of towns and cities across the country and security forces reportedly gunned down dozens of people. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Despite a string of government concessions earlier in the week, including the lifting of the hated 48-year-old emergency law, tens of thousands of demonstrators demanding greater political freedom and an end to Ba'ath party rule took to the streets after Friday prayers. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Security forces around Damascus and other key cities ignored appeals to eschew violence, opening fire with live rounds and using teargas against several pro-democracy protests, activists and witnesses reported. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Although information was difficult to obtain, at least 88 people were reported killed, including two in Douma, one in Homs, and at least six in the southern town of Izraa, and others in Moudamiya, outside Damascus, the activists said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] With more casualties being reported by the hour, there were fears the final toll would be significantly higher. The White House urged Damascus to follow through on promised reforms. Barack Obama called on the Syrian government to stop using violence against demonstrators and accused Assad of seeking help from Iran. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'This outrageous use of violence to quell protests must come to an end now,' Obama said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'Instead of listening to their own people, President Assad is blaming outsiders while seeking Iranian assistance in repressing Syria's citizens through the same brutal tactics that have been used by his Iranian allies.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Foreign secretary William Hague condemned the 'unacceptable killing of demonstrators' and called on Syrian security forces 'to exercise restraint instead of repression'. He said the authorities should respect the 'people's right to peaceful protest'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] More than 280 people are believed to have been killed since the unrest began six weeks ago. Twenty-one protesters were killed this week in Homs. Activists and observersin Damascus who described today's events as a watershed moment, said their impression was that protests had been bigger than on the past seven Fridays and more bloody. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The protesters' demands varied from place to place. In Kisweh, near Damascus, people called for freedom. In the Mediterranean city of Banias, they chanted: 'The people want to topple the regime.' Other protesters directed their anger directly at members of the ruling family. 'God, freedom and Syria only. God is greatest!' was another rallying cry. In some Damascus neighbourhoods, statues and posters of Assad and his late father, the former president Hafez al-Assad, were torn down, and there was chanting against Maher al-Assad, Bashar's younger brother, who commands the army's elite 4th division. Its soldiers, regarded by many Syrians as a private militia, have been reportedly responsible for shootings in Deraa and elsewhere. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In the Damascus district of Midan, 2,000 people chanted: 'Zanga zanga, dar dar, Maher is a bigger moron than Bashar!' Another Assad family member, Rami Makhlouf, a business tycoon who is the president's cousin, was also a target of the protesters' wrath. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Fulfilling an earlier vow to step up the protests on what they called 'Great Friday', demonstrators also rallied in the eastern towns of Deir al-Zor and Qamishli. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In the city of Hama, where Hafez al-Assad ruthlessly crushed an armed Islamist uprising nearly 30 years ago, a witness told Reuters that security forces opened fire to prevent protesters from reaching the Ba'ath party headquarters. 'We saw two snipers on the building. None of us had weapons. There are casualties, possibly two dead,' the witness said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] After prayers finished in Deraa, where the protests first began on 15 March, several thousand protesters gathered, chanting anti-Assad slogans. 'The Syrian people will not be subjugated. Go away doctor [Assad]. We will trample on you and your slaughterous regime,' they shouted. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Unrest was also reported in Raqqa, close to Damascus, Sayda Zeinab, Harasta and Barzeh in Damascus, Tartous, a coastal town, the western port city of Latakia, and the north-eastern towns of Ras al-Ayn, Amouda and al-Hassakeh. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The scale and nationwide reach of Friday's protests suggested Assad's concessions, far from defusing popular discontent, may have been seen as a sign of weakness by demonstratorsnow doubly determined to achieve their aim. But there is as yet no clear agreement on what their aims are: accelerated democratic reform, greater economic opportunity, an end to corruption among Syria's wealthy elite, or all-out regime change. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In a sign of improving opposition organisation, activists co-ordinating the protests demanded the abolition of the Ba'ath party monopoly on power and the establishment of a democratic system. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] They did not call for Assad to stand down. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In their first joint statement, seen by the Guardian, the self-styled 'local co-ordination committees', representing provinces across Syria, said that 'freedom and dignity slogans cannot be achieved except through peaceful democratic change'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'All prisoners of conscience must be freed. The existing security apparatus has to be dismantled and replaced by one with specific jurisdiction and which operates according to law.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] On Thursday, Assad signed a decree lifting the emergency law, imposed by his Ba'ath party when it took power in a coup 48 years ago. He also replaced the cabinet and approved new rights of peaceful protest. But other laws still give security forces sweeping powers. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] But the first application to protest under the new law ended in the temporary detention of the applicant. Fadel al-Faisal from Hassakeh was held for several hours after filing a request to hold a demonstration. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Joe Stork of Human Rights Watch said the reforms 'will only be meaningful if Syria's security services stop shooting, detaining, and torturing protesters'. Syria officials have blamed armed groups, infiltrators and Sunni Muslim militants for provoking violence at demonstrations by firing on civilians and security forces. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Earlier, Reem Haddad, spokeswoman for the ministry of information told al Jazeera: 'I think if the people protest peacefully, if they cause no harm, if they don't burn or destroy, I think [security forces] will allow them to do so [protest], and I think after a certain time they will actually disperse them, tell them to go home.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Asked at what point forces would open fire on protesters, she said: 'If they are shot at, which has been the case previously.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] While calling for an end to the violence and democratic reform, western and other Arab countries have mostly muted their criticism of the killings and repression in Syria for fear of destabilising the country, which plays a strategic role across the Middle East.

world/2011/nov/18/free-syria-army-lebanese-border,2011-11-18,Free Syria Army gathers on Lebanese border,"Somewhere along the emerald green ridge ahead Syrian troops guard the restive border with Lebanon. Behind them lie piles of upturned orange earth where land mines have been freshly buried. Ahead of them, across a deep, rain-soaked valley which spills into Lebanon, the rebels who were once their comrades in arms are preparing for war. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The rebels of the Free Syria Army who have found refuge on this volatile strip of borderland move freely around on motorbikes that are well within range of Syrian loyalist snipers. But they say they no longer fear their former army colleagues in the hills nearby. Instead, they are looking to them for help. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'There are 100 of them in the valley,' said a former member of an intelligence unit who fled the embattled city of Hama in August and is now based in the Lebanese village of Nsoub. 'But the day before yesterday I personally brought 30 people here.' Of the troops still serving with the Syrian army, he said: 'They helped.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Senior commanders have ordered their men to seal the border, but the sharp rise in defectors to have crossed into northern Lebanon in the past week suggests that many soldiers are already hedging their bets. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] And Syria's growing isolation also seems to be invigorating the exiled defectors, who this week received about 70 men who were all sent on to safety within a day of crossing the border. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'We have been talking with them [the nearby troops] for many months,' says a second man, a Lebanese national who lived in Syria for 25 years, but fled when the uprising started in March. 'There are many who are waiting to see what happens before making their move.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] This rag-tag group does not pretend to have a leader calling the shots. Like the rest of the nascent Free Syria Army, the rebels of north Lebanon appear to be a loosely formed force with no direction from any central command. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] But someone in northern Lebanon is helping them co-ordinate an exodus, and plan for an escalation that they all say is now inevitable. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'Most of the [defecting] soldiers are not deployed in the places where they live,' said the newly returned Lebanese man. 'So when they get [into Lebanon] they are being sent on to cross the border [back into Syria] in the nearest area to their home.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Some of the group of 30 who arrived on Wednesday are thought to have been sent to Turkey, where they will then be redeployed to areas along the border near their home villages. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Once inside Syria the men will join the growing band of rebels, who have launched a string of attacks on regime forces, culminating this week in their most audacious operation so far: an assault on naval intelligence bases on the outskirts of Damascus. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The men say they don't know who paid for their journeys. 'All I know is that I call members of the co-ordinating committee,' said the defected soldier. 'They come and get them and then I don't see them. There are definitely more [defectors] than there used to be.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Those who have fled say the situation inside Syria has now passed the point of no return. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] When protests against the government of President Bashar al-Assad began earlier this year there was little overt animosity between the country's Sunni majority and the Alawite minority from which Assad draws his most loyal support. But after eight months of a brutal crackdown sectarian tensions have grown worse. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'Anyone who leaves is considered a terrorist,' said the Lebanese man. 'And it's mostly the Sunnis who are leaving, because they face persecution.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The defector, who served in an army intelligence unit in Hama, where tens of thousands were killed in 1982 by the regime of Assad's father, Hafez, said Sunni men were being tortured just for having beards. 'Electricity, water anything,' he said. 'Very, very bad treatment.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The deteriorating situation inside Syria feels like a self-fulfilling prophecy. A sectarian divide that did not exist in March is now a dangerous faultline in many areas of the country. The former soldier said: 'They are killing each other already. Sunnis are killing Alawites and vice versa. I personally saw an Alawite who was killing [Sunnis] in front of me.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'They have said it so many times that people now believe that the Sunnis are the troublemakers. It's all lies,' said the Syrian villager. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'One of the officers told us after Ramadan that he had the wrong impression of us,' said the Lebanese man. 'He said he was told we were terrorists and bad people. Then he was taken away and interrogated and tortured for a month – all because he had good relations with us. Now Alawite officers have moved in and things are different.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Alawite officers and their Sunni troops remain somewhere in the valley, which is an active smuggling route. Behind them is Semma Kieh, once a Sunni village which the exiled Syrians say serves as the regime's last outpost. The five men all say most Sunnis have been forced to flee, and regime loyalists, all members of the Alawite sect, have moved in. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Behind Semma Kieh is an Alawite village, then a Christian enclave. Turn left towards Homs and it's like that for 30 miles. The road right to Hama is the same. But this patchwork quilt of sects, loyalists and defectors is fast unravelling. I asked all five men whether war was now inevitable. All said it was.

world/middle-east-live/2012/may/03/egypt-syria-bahrain-libya,2012-05-03,Syrian forces raid university – Thursday 3 May,"4.59pm: Here's a summary of today's main developments: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syria [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • At least four students have been killed after security services stormed dorms at Aleppo University, activists and opposition groups said. Dozens more were injured and scores arrested, according to the reports. The Local Coordination Committees activist group put the death toll at seven, including a student it said was thrown from a fifth-floor window by pro-Assad thugs. Others said four people were killed. The university announced that it was suspending classes until exam finals on 13 May 'due to the current situation'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Thousands of people attended the funeral of Ismail Haidar, the son of the leader of a Syrian opposition party, who was killed on Wednesday. Both sides appeared to blame each other for his slaying. The state news agency reported that Haidar, son of Syrian Social Nationalist party (SSNP) leader Ali Haidar, was in a car with another party member, who was also killed, when an 'armed terrorist group' - words it commonly uses to describe opposition fighters - opened fire with machine guns on the road between Homs and Masyaf. The Local Coordination Committees described him as a martyr, implying that the security services were responsible. A SSNP member told al-Akhbar that the party, which calls for democratic change and rejects the militarisation of the uprising, has enemies on both sides. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The Syrian government imported $167m-worth of air defence systems and missiles and a further $1m of small arms and ammunition in the months before it began the crackdown on opposition activists, a report by the charity Oxfam says. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Two sons of Fayez Sara, a prominent opposition figure, have been arrested and taken to an unknown location, he told AFP. Sara, who co-founded the Association of Syrian Journalists in February, told the news agency the security forces did not produce an arrest warrant or specify any charges against them. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Egypt [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The military rulers have expressed sorrow for the bloodshed in Abbasiya but said protesters should have demonstrated in Tahrir Square instead. At a press conference on the violence, they also insisted they were committed to handing over power by 30 June. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Tunisia [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The head of Nessma TV, Nabil Karoui, has been fined 2,400 dinars (about $1,500) for broadcasting the award-winning film, Persepolis, after being convicted of a public order offence. Hedi Boughnim, who dubbed the film into Tunisian dialect, was also fined 1,200 dinars (about $750). [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 4.57pm: Syria: A video has been posted of the head of the UN observer mission, Maj Gen Robert Mood, meeting activists and soldiers who have defected, in Homs. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Talking to solidiers from the Free Syrian Army, he can he heard saying: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] I have tremendous respect for the aspirations of the Syrian people ...I have respect for what the people are trying to achieve but based on my mandate and based on my beliefs, I think all of us have to find [a way] and contribute to make that happen. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 4.19pm: Syria: The Local Coordination Committees activist group says the death toll at Aleppo University has risen to seven. Its reports cannot be independently verified. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The LCC claims that a total of 22 people have been killed by the security forces in Syria today. It says the other deaths were in Homs (six), Damascus suburbs (three), Deraa and Hama (two each). One person was killed in each of Idlib and al-Hasakeh, according to the LCC. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 4.13pm: Syria: Brown Moses, blogger and regular BTL commenter on Middle East Live, claims to have exposed what he labels 'Syrian regime propaganda at work' on the pro-Assad Syrian TV channel Addounia TV. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Writing about this video, he says: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The gentleman in the video is an Algerian claiming to be staying in Homs, and denounces the 'fake' footage of Homs being shown on al-Jazeera Arabic, filming both the television to show the al-Jazeera footage of Homs, and outside his hotel window, 'proving' the al-Jazeera footage is 'fake'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Unfortunately for our dimwitted Algerian friend he makes a few key mistakes while filming the video. One thing you should always avoid doing if you are going to pretend to be somewhere you are not is giving the viewer a chance to figure out where you actually are, such as clearly filming the lay out of streets and buildings, or filming signs with phone numbers on them that include the area code. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Having examined the area code, the street layout and position of the buildings and trees, Brown Moses claims to have pinpointed where the video was actually filmed ...in Damascus. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 4.03pm: Yemen: A second relative of ex-president Saleh holding a key military post has been persuaded to quit, AFP reports. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] General Tariq Mohammed Abdullah Saleh, a nephew of the ex-president, finally gave up his command of the presidential guard today after resisting his dismissal for a month, UN envoy Jamal Benomar is reported as saying. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Last month, the air force chief, General Mohammed Saleh al-Ahmar – a half-brother of the ex-president – stepped down after also resisting dismissal for several weeks. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] AFP says the ex-president's nephew rejected an alternative posting to the distant province of Hadramawt. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 3.45pm: Syria: Aleppo University has said (Arabic link) that 'due to the current situation' classes have been suspended until exam finals on 13 May. It says: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Dear students, due to the current situation, classes of theory-based majors will be suspended until the beginning of exams. Classes of practice-based majors and institutes will be suspended until 13 May 2012, in order for the practice-based exams to take place. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] English translation via al-akhbar. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 3.37pm: Syria: Two sons of a prominent opposition figure have been arrested, AFP reports. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Fayez Sara, who co-founded the Association of Syrian Journalists in February, told the news agency that he does not know where his sons were taken. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'Security forces stormed the apartment where the brothers live at 6am (4am BST). They broke down the door looking for weapons and took Bassam, 37, and Wissam, 26,' Sara told AFP by telephone. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] According to the activist, 'the security forces did not present an arrest warrant or disclose the charges.' His sons who suffer from health problems were 'not allowed to take their medication with them.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 3.23pm: Syria: The funeral has been taking place in Masyaf of Ismail Haidar, the son of Ali Haidar, the leader of the opposition Syrian Social National party (SSNP). Haidar, and another party member, were killed when machine guns fired at the car they were travelling (see 10.57am) in on the road between Homs and Masyaf. The state news agency blamed an 'armed terrorist group', which it routinely uses to describe opposition fighters. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] But the Local Coordination Committtees, which only records deaths it says have occurred at the hands of the security forces, featured photographs of his funeral on its website and described him as a martyr. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 3.12pm: Syria: A student named as Samer Qawas, a first year Islamic studies student from Idib, died after being thrown from the fifth floor of a dorm at Aleppo University by Shabiha (pro-government militia), the Local Coordination Committees activist group claims. The Guardian cannot independently verify the LCC's reports. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 3.01pm: Bahrain: The government's Orwellian-style celebration of World Press Freedom day continues. The official news agency has now issued the full text of King Hamad's speech (see 9.23am) on the 'blossoming' of media freedom. The interior ministry has also joined in, on Twitter: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] MOI wishes happy World Press Freedom Day to Bahrain's press & hails its distinguished national role [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] — Ministry of Interior (@moi_bahrain) May 3, 2012 [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Another Twitter user, though, is not impressed: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] #Bahrain's King Hamad gives a Gaddafi/Mugabe style speech celebrating International Day for Press Freedom..

It says on its website: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Since the start of the country's pro-democracy movement in February last year, the government has tried to control news about the protests and the excesses of police and troops towards the protesters by using a formidable array of weapons. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Foreign journalists have been arrested and deported, and others have encountered severe difficulties in obtaining entry visas, Bahrainis wanting to tell foreign news organizstions what is happening have been threatened ... [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Free-speech activists have been hounded and prosecuted, photographers, bloggers and netizens arrested (one of them dying in prison), journalists forced to resign from the main opposition paper and called before the state prosecutor, and printing any news about ongoing investigations by the military prosecutor banned for supposed national security reasons. The media blackout has been accompanied by a big regime propaganda campaign, through media it controls, against major protest leaders, who are dubbed traitors or terrorists. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The government media also has a history of making up quotes that appear to show support for the regime's policies from international organisations and figures. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 2.46pm: Syria: The UN observer mission has been in Homs today. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Their visit was livestreamed on Bambuser. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Homs-based activist @BigAlBrand tweets: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The head of the UN observers' team in Syria is now in Homs. That explains the lack of shelling and gunfire. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] — Big Al (@BigAlBrand) May 3, 2012 [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] AP says the head of the UN observers, Norwegian Major General Robert Mood, also visited Hama today: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Reporters accompanying the observers on the tour interviewed residents who said life was fairly normal during the day but was worrisome at night. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'The situation is calm during the day but scary at night,' said Maher Jerjous, a 53-year-old resident of the Bab al-Quba district in Hama. 'Masked gunmen ... roam the streets. There are kidnappings on public roads. You will not see anyone (on the streets) after six.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 2.31pm: Syria: More videos are emerging from Aleppo, both from today and last night. Activists say security forces are continuing with arrests of students. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] This one shows students being led away by security forces. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] This one, purportedly filmed today, shows members of the security forces brandishing batons arriving at the university. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] This video, of a demonstration, was reportedly filmed at the university's faculty of literature today. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The university has reportedly suspended lectures following the bloodshed. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] This video shows students standing with suitcases outside the university gates. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Another video purports to show the security forces moving into the university last night. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Finally, this video is said to show the wreckage in the dorms after last night's raid. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 1.19pm: Egypt: The ruling military council is committed to handing over power to a civilian administration by 1 July as it promised, the Associated Press reports, citing a senior member of the council. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The announcement came a day after deadly clashes between protesters and assailants left at least 11 dead in Cairo, prompting some politicians to voice fears that the military might use the violence as a pretext to ignore its own deadline to relinquish control of the country. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Maj Gen Mohammed al-Asar also told reporters that the military will ensure the integrity and fairness of presidential elections scheduled for May 23-24. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The military took over after a popular uprising ousted Egypt's authoritarian leader Hosni Mubarak in February 2011. But in over a year in power, it has been accused of badly bungling the transition, killing protesters, hauling more than 10,000 civilians to trial before military tribunals and of scheming to enshrine a political role for itself after handing over power. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'We say it frankly and clearly, the armed forces and their supreme council are committed to the handover of power on June 30,' al-Asar said. 'We don't desire power. The Supreme Council (of the Armed Forces) is not a substitute for legitimacy in Egypt.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 1.00pm: Here's a summary of the main developments so far today. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syria [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • At least four students have been killed after security services stormed dorms at Aleppo University, activists and opposition groups said. Dozens more were injured and scores arrested, according to the reports. There have numerous clashes at the university and the assault followed the biggest demonstration there since the beginning of the uprising, according to an opposition website. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The son of the leader of a Syrian opposition party has been killed, the state news agency reported, blaming an armed terrorist group. Ismail Haidar, son of Syrian Social Nationalist party (SSNP) leader Ali Haidar was with another party member, who was also killed, when machine guns opened fire on their car on the road between Homs and Masyaf. A SSNP member told al-Akhbar that the party, which calls for democratic change and rejects the militarisation of the uprising, has enemies on both sides. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The Syrian government imported $167m-worth of air defence systems and missiles and a further $1m of small arms and ammunition in the months before it began the crackdown on opposition activists, a report by the charity Oxfam says. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Egypt [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The military rulers have expressed sorrow for the bloodshed in Abbasiya but said protesters should have demonstrated in Tahrir Square instead. At a press conference on the violence, they also insisted they were committed to handing over power by 30 June. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Tunisia [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The head of Nessma TV, Nabil Karoui, has been fined 2,400 dinars (about $1,500) for broadcasting the award-winning film, Persepolis, after being convicted of a public order offence. Hedi Boughnim, who dubbed the film into Tunisian dialect, was also fined 1,200 dinars (about $750). [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 12.29pm: Syria: More arrests are being carried out at the campus of Aleppo University - where activists say at least four students were killed earlier today and scores arrested by government forces - according to the Local Coordination Committees opposition group. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 12.08pm: Syria: The assault by the security forces at Aleppo University last night followed the largest anti-regime demonstration at the university to date, the opposition website al-Ayyam says. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] This video purports to show the demonstration yesterday. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Al-Ayyam says: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The protest drew many students and was the largest protest at Aleppo University to date. Security forces arrived quickly on the scene and assaulted the protesting students forcing them to disperse and fold back. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The main assault [was] overnight. The students started another protest in the university's housing complex. They launched the protest from their rooms. Witnesses report that three buses carrying security forces and Shabbiha [pro-regime thugs] surrounded and laid siege to the housing complex. The attack started shortly after midnight Thursday and lasted about an hour. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Security forces stormed the complex with five military vehicles while firing from mounted machine guns. The initial assault caused widespread damage and killed two students. Security forces and Shabbiha followed on foot. They searched room by room, breaking in, and firing bursts of gunfire to intimidate the students. More than 50 students were seen being taken away. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 11.50am: Libya: The National Transitional Council yesterday passed a number of laws criminalising the 'glorification' of the late Muammar Gaddafi, his regime and his sons, the Tripoli Post reports: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] This law and other two laws that aim to protect the nation and the new democratic Libya have been under debate for some time and have been demanded by a large part of the population. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The remnants of pro-Gaddafi elements have exploited the atmosphere of forgiveness and the spirit of reconciliation expressed by the leaders of the uprising and has been working undercover to undermine the state for some time now. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Tripoli Post quotes a statement read out to reporters by a judicial official: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Praising or glorifying Muammar Gaddfi, his regime, his ideas or his sons ... is punishable by a prison sentence ... [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] If those news reports, rumours or propaganda cause any damage to the state the penalty will be life in prison ... [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In conditions of war, there is a prison sentence for any person who spreads information and rumors which disrupt military preparations for the defense of the country, spread terror or weaken the citizens' morale. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] (Libya is still considered to be in a state of war, apparently.) [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A second law stipulates prison sentences for anyone who 'attacks the February 17 revolution, denigrates Islam, the authority of the state or its institutions,' the Tripoli Post says, stating that these are laws 'governing the transition' – which perhaps means that they are intended to be temporary. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A third new law promulgated yesterday confiscates all property and funds belonging to figures of the previous regime, including Gaddafi's relatives. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 11.21am: Yemen: Democracy is America's second choice in Yemen, counter-radicalisation expert Francisco Martin-Rayo argues in an article for Foreign Policy that is highly critical of the Obama administration and its apparent obsession with al-Qaida: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Though Yemen's internal politics have changed dramatically since January 2011, US strategy there has remained single-mindedly focused on eradicating AQAP [al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula]. Democracy promotion, and the hopes of millions of Yemenis who supported the revolution, do not appear to be among the Obama administration's concerns in the country. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Nowhere was this more clear than in a recent press conference in Sana'a, where Jeffrey Feltman, the assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, reinforced US support for the existing transition plan, which doesn't call for elections until February 2014 and which has widely left President Saleh's patronage network intact. (His son, Ahmed Ali Abdullah Saleh, still controls the Republican Guard and Special Forces – a fact that inspires considerable disquiet among members of the pro-democracy opposition.) [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Since the beginning of the demonstrations against President Saleh's regime, the US has signally failed to support the pro-democracy youth movement, a group that consists largely of the young and dissatisfied men that AQAP recruits so assiduously ... [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In April 2011, the youth movement openly petitioned the US for support, only to be ignored. The US instead supported the Gulf Cooperation Council's (GCC) negotiations with the old regime, squashing any hopes of an authentic democratic revolution and antagonising Washington's most likely local allies. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 11.05am: Tunisia: It appears that Nabil Karoui, the head of Nessma TV, has been convicted of a public order or 'morality' offence rather than blasphemy in the Persepolis trial. This may explain why he has been fined rather than jailed. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] According to Le Nouvel Observateur (in French), the court judgment said he was punished for 'broadcasting to the public a film that disturbed public order and was contrary to good morals'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Tunisia Live says Hedi Boughnim, who dubbed the award-winning film into Tunisian dialect, was also fined 1,200 dinars (about $750). [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 10.57am: Syria: The son of the leader of the opposition Syrian Social Nationalist party (SSNP) was assassinated on Wednesday by an armed terrorist group, the state news agency reports. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Ismail Haidar, son of Ali Haidar, was killed alongside another SSNP member, Fadi Atawneh, by machine gun fire on the road between Homs and Masyaf, says Sana. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The SSNP, founded by Lebanese academic Antun Saadeh in the 1930s, is 'an opposition party calling for democratic change in Syria, but adamantly rejected foreign intervention and the militarisation of the uprising,' says al-Akhbar. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] It quotes an anonymous high-ranking member of the SSNP based in the US as saying: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The SSNP has taken a position that is neither to the complete liking of the regime nor to the complete liking of many elements in the opposition, but which it feels represents the interest of Syria, which should be above all other interests. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Unfortunately, certain elements on the ground believe that unless you are 100% with them, then you are 100% against them, and as a result two young members of the SSNP have paid with their lives for the party's position. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Mohammad Zahweh, from the SSNP, told Al-Akhbar. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] It happened yesterday evening. There were gunmen waiting [on the street] and they began firing on the car ... We have received threats, particularly against the president [of] the party, but we couldn't specify the source of those threats. I can't really say for sure [who was responsible]. The investigation is underway [and] we don't want to guess who was behind it, it could've been a criminal act. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Sana quotes SSNP leader Ali Haidar as saying: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] I don't need condolences over the deaths of my son and his comrade, because their blood is no more precious than the blood of any Syrian that was martyred before or will be martyred in the coming days ... Those who carry guns will not terrorise us and will not silence us nor stop is from working day and night to establish peace and security in Syria ...Ismael and his comrade are the victims of terrorism that is afflicting Syria… they, like the rest of the martyrs, fell so that Syria may live, for Syria's interest is above all interests. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 10.45am: Tunisia: Reports are coming in that the head of Nessma TV has been fined 2,400 dinars (about $1,500) for broadcasting the film, Persepolis, which religious elements complained was blasphemous. More details shortly. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 10.36am: Bahrain: The kingdom's human rights record will come under scrutiny at the UN Human Rights Council later this month, as part of the 'periodic review' system. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] As part of that process, the kingdom has submitted a report detaiing its achievements since the last review in 2008. As usual with these reports, it gives a fairly glowing picture. It also refers to the king as 'beloved' three times (pages 8, 20 and 25) and 'dearly beloved' once (page 7). [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A second report, by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, is less congratulatory. It complains about 'a deterioration in the human rights situation' and notes 'with concern' allegations of torture, including the torture of children. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 10.19am: Syria: In another video from Aleppo University, where activists say at least four students were killed (see 9.40am), the sound of intense gunfire can be heard. It is difficult to make out the different figures running outside as the video is filmed from a room high off the ground. A voiceover at the end says 'Assad mukhabarat [secret police].' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Another video purports to show students outside the dormitories amid their belongings, strewn on the ground. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 10.03am: Tunisia: Two police officers who killed a protester last year have been jailed for 20 years each – the first punishment meted out to security officials over their crackdown on the revolution that ousted President Ben Ali, Reuters reports. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The officers were also fined 80,000 dinars ($60,000) each for their role in the death of Salim al-Hadhary, a source said. The money will go to the victim's family. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 9.40am: Syria: Syrian security forces stormed student dorms at Aleppo University in the north-west of the country following anti-government protests there, killing at least four students and wounding several others with teargas and live ammunition, activists and opposition groups said today. From AP . [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Around 1,500 students had been protesting in student quarters adjacent to Aleppo University's main campus late Wednesday when security forces and pro-regime gunmen swept into their residences, firing tear gas at first, then live ammunition to disperse them. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Student activist Thaer al-Ahmed said panic and chaos ensued as students tried to flee. 'Some students ran to their rooms to take cover but they were followed to their rooms, beaten up and arrested,' he said. [NEW PARAGRAPH] He said raids and intermittent gunfire continued until early Thursday morning. Dozens of people were wounded, some critically, and around 50 students were arrested, he said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Local Coordination Committees activist group confirmed the raid and said five students were killed and some 200 arrested while the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said four students were killed. 'Regime forces demanded through loudspeakers that the dorms be evacuated, then began detaining the students,' the LCC said in a statement. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The LCC says demonstrations are taking place now, both elsewhere on the campus and outside the campus, in solidarity with the students who were attacked. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A video posted online purports to show a student who was shot. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] This video shows purports to show a fire still blazing at the university dorms after the attacks. http://youtu.be/uulRMOFytWc [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A picture of one of those said to have been killed, named as Majed Abdulhaid, has been posted on Twitter. (warning:graphic) [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 9.33am: Syria: Will it end in stalemate or checkmate? The New York Times is intrigued to discover that the president of the World Chess Federation was in Damascus at the weekend and had three hours of talks with President Assad . [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] It says Kirsan Ilyumzhinov – described as 'an eccentric Russian millionaire' – was officially visiting Syria to promote the teaching of chess in schools, though the paper notes that he also went to Libya last year in an effort to negotiate a settlement between the Libyan rebels and Colonel Gaddafi: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Although he holds no formal diplomatic position with the Russian government, his repeated visits to Arab countries in turmoil have reinforced the impression that he is serving as an informal envoy, using the chess organization's business as a fittingly Russian ruse. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 9.23am: Bahrain: To mark World Press Freedom Day, King Hamad has announced 'a new era' for Bahrain's media, the pro-government Gulf Daily News reports. The king is quoted as saying: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] There should be no tampering with the right of Bahraini citizens in expressing their opinions, nor any ceilings put on their freedoms or creativity apart from professional consciousness, national and ethical responsibilities and observance of the people's unity and national interest in compliance with the constitution and the law. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Media freedoms are ushering in a more advanced phase of diversity, independence and respect of opinion and counter-opinion. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The king added that legislation to 'boost freedom of opinion and expression in compliance with highest international standards' was on in preparation. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 9.00am: Good morning. Welcome to Middle East Live. During the day we shall be monitoring unrest in Syria, Egypt, Bahrain and other parts of the region, and keeping an eye on the growing problems faced by the Un monitoring operation in Syria. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syria [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The UN monitoring mission is in trouble – and not just on the ground in Syria, where the monitors are constantly tailed by the authorities. 'The UN is making repeated calls to member states seeking personnel as it tries to deploy the full force by the end of May,' Bloomberg reports. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] It adds that the deployment is hindered by the acknowledgment of US and other security council diplomats that the mission is likely to fail and that its purpose is to convince Russia and China that stronger measures, which they previously blocked, are needed to force President Bashar al-Assad to stop killing his opponents and civilians. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • In a statement last night, the Avaaz organisation said the Annan plan is 'in the gutter'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Referring to developments in Homs, it said 'While the pace of bombardment slowed significantly ever since the UN observers arrived in the city, the Annan plan is not being upheld. Armed opposition groups remain inside the city while the regime's forces retain a formidable presence.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The Syrian government imported $167m-worth of air defence systems and missiles and a further $1m of small arms and ammunition in the months before it began the crackdown on opposition activists, a report by the charity Oxfam says. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Egypt [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The ruling military council (Scaf) says it was not reponsible for the deaths of 11 or more protesters during recent clashes in Cairo and will hold a press conference later today, the Egypt Independent reports. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A statement on Scaf's Facebook page says: 'The armed forces have over the last week endured what it cannot tolerate of insults and attacks from demonstrators in front of the defence ministry.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Libya [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Shokri Ghanem, Libya's former oil chief who was found drowned in the river Danube on Sunday, was wanted for questioning in Libya, [NEW PARAGRAPH] Reuters reports. The Libyan authorities had sent a warrant to Interpol about a month ago but were still awaiting a 'decisive reply'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The National Transitional Council has lifted controversial restrictions on the types of political parties that can take part in next month's election, the BBC reports. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In April the NTC had announced a ban on parties organised along religious, regional, tribal or ethnic lines, saying that this was a measure to preserve 'national unity'. But yesterday it issued a new version of the law which made no mention of the restrictions.

world/2012/feb/10/syria-violence-aleppo-blasts,2012-02-10,Syria violence spreads to Aleppo as bomb blasts kill 28,"Violence spread to Syria's largest city, Aleppo, on Friday with two blasts outside security compounds that left 28 people dead. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The explosions outside military intelligence and police compounds were blamed on terrorists by the state media. Some 175 people were injured, the worst day Aleppo has seen since the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began last year. The northern city and economic hub has been largely quiet, but protests had been planned for Friday. Anti-Assad activists accused the regime of setting off the blasts to discredit the opposition and disrupt demonstrations. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In Homs, government forces continued their siege of rebel-held districts and other opposition areas, going house to house arresting people in the Insha'at district and keeping up an artillery and tank barrage on Baba Amr. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The intensified campaign began with the failure of the UN security council to agree on a common position last weekend, when Russia and China vetoed a resolution backing an Arab League peace plan and calling on Assad to step down. Moscow and Beijing stuck to their positions on Friday, dashing any residual hopes of a diplomatic breakthrough in the security council. Russia's deputy foreign minister, Sergey Ryabkov, accused the west of arming the rebel Free Syrian Army. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'Western states inciting Syrian opposition to uncompromising actions, as well as those sending arms to them, giving them advice and direction, are participating in the process of fomenting the crisis,' he said, according to Itar-Tass news agency. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Western governments have denied supplying arms to the Free Syrian Army, which officials on on Friday referred to as a ragtag force of local militias and army deserters. 'The Free Syrian Army is less cohesive than the name suggests. In a number of neighbourhoods it is a combination of local residents and defecting soldiers,' a senior European diplomat said, on condition of anonymity. While there have been reports of Gulf states providing arms, observers said there were no sign of modern or sophisticated weapons in rebel hands and that the Free Syria Army had trouble smuggling arms across the Turkish and Jordanian borders. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The US ambassador to Syria yesterday posted satellite imagery on Facebook to show proof of government attacks on residential neighbourhoods in Homs. The commercial satellite image, posted days after closing the embassy in Damascus and titled 'Security Operations Escalate in Homs,' has labels pointing out burning buildings, smoke, impact craters, military vehicles and armored vehicles. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] However Western capitals have stressed that diplomatic initiatives will be left to Arab states and Turkey. Foreign ministers from the Gulf Cooperation Council are due to meet on Saturday in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and the Arab League is due to convene in Cairo on Sunday, to draft a new strategy to raise pressure on Damascus without Russian or Chinese help. That strategy is expected to include the creation of a 'friends of Syria' group excluding Moscow and Beijing, to impose new sanctions and to rally support for the Arab League peace plan in the UN general assembly. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Turkey and some Arab states have been pressing for urgent action to help pockets of Syrian civilians caught in the conflict with little access to food, water or medical supplies. US and European countries have been resolutely opposed to the creation of a 'safe zone' or 'humanitarian corridors' because they would require significant military backup to enforce. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'All this talk of humanitarian corridors and no-fly zones – once you start to go through with it and unless you follow it through, you do more harm than good,' the European diplomat said. 'A corridor has to be legal and properly protected. Otherwise you expose aid workers to danger, for example. You can't do this unless you are ready to go the whole hog.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Russian and Chinese resistance in the security council means it is impossible for now for the international criminal court to start investigating the Assad regime for crimes against humanity. The UN high commissioner for human rights, Navi Pillay, is due to address the general assembly on Monday to press the case for indictments. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'We believe, and we've said it and we'll keep repeating it, that the case of Syria belongs in the international criminal court. This would give a very, very strong message to those running the show,' Rupert Colville, Pillay's spokesman, said It was also reported that western diplomats have told Syrian officials involved in the suppression of anti-regime protests that they will eventually be held accountable for their actions. Efforts are under way in Western capitals to assemble evidence of human rights abuses by members of president Bashar al Assad's regime with a view to use in future proceedings.. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] British officials said the UK government had been providing training and materials for independent human rights groups to record suspected atrocities, to provide admissible evidence for future trials at the international criminal court or elsewhere. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'The UK has funded and is continuing to fund work aimed at collecting evidence of crimes and preserve that evidence so that it can be used at a later date,' the official said. 'Even though these people may be out of reach of justice today, there may come a time when are they are not.'","Julian Borger, diplomatic editor",The Guardian
world/middle-east-live/2012/oct/08/turkey-syria-border-clashes-live,2012-10-09,Syria crisis: Homs on the brink - Monday 8 October 2012,"4.04pm BST [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Summary [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Here's a summary of the main events today: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syria [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The rebel stronghold of Homs is on the brink of falling to the Syrian army, according to opposition activists and residents. A resident told the Guardian that the army already controlled 75% of the city and was advancing swiftly. He said: 'Homs might fall to the Syrian army at any moment. The army are taking street after street, progressing towards us little by little.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The Free Syrian Army commander in charge of defending Homs has made an appeal for weapons to help repel the government offensive. Colonel Qassim Saadeddine told the Guardian: 'We only have light weapons. We desperately need heavy weapons to stop them.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon said he was 'deeply concerned' about the continued flow of arms to both the Syrian government and opposition forces. He also described as 'extremely dangerous' the escalating conflict along the Syrian-Turkish border and the impact of the crisis on Lebanon. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The opposition Syrian National Council is set to discuss whether to back Turkey's idea of a transition government led by Syria's most senior Sunni politician - vice-president Farouq al-Sharaa. The opposition appears to be softening its stance on former regime members playing a role in a future government. It said it did not want to repeat the mistakes of de-Ba'athification in Iraq. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Mitt Romney is set to call for an escalation of the conflict by arming the rebels with the heavy weapons. In a foreign policy speech to be delivered later, he will say: 'I will work with our partners to identify and organise those members of the opposition who share our values and ensure they obtain the arms they need to defeat Assad's tanks, helicopters and fighter jets.' The Obama administration has warned Qatar and Saudi Arabia not to provide heavy weapons to the rebels in case they fall into the wrong hands, according to the New York Times. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Qatar has urged a Syrian rebel group not to carry out a threat to kill 48 Iranians seized two months ago near Damascus. Prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jasim al-Thani made the appeal following a request from Iran to secure the release of the captives. 'We hope that the matter is addressed wisely and through dialogue rather than killing hostages', he said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Hezbollah is covertly providing men and support to the Assad government and currently has about 1,500 members inside Syria, a former member of Syria's air force intelligence branch told the Times. “There are about 1,500 Hezbollah and 1,500 Iranians in Syria right now,” the officer, who defected in August, claimed. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Libya [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Libya's parliament has sacked its prime minister-elect, Mustafa Abushagur, leaving the government in disarray three months after the July elections. Abushagur's dismissal, with 125 of the 200 MPs rejecting him, underlines the problem of a congress where regionally elected members make up a majority, and where the main parties - the pro-business National Forces Alliance and the Muslim Brotherhood's Justice and Construction party - have both failed to form working majorities. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Kuwait [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • In the latest bid to end a political standoff the emir has dissolved parliament, three months after it was reinstated by the constitutional court, al-Jazeera reports. The dissolution of the assembly has been a main demand of the opposition and the action paves the way for snap polls. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Updated at 4.55pm BST [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 3.51pm BST [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Turkey urges international action on Syria [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Turkey's president, Abdullah Gul, has described the crisis in Syria as the 'worst-case scenario' and urged the international community to act, according to Reuters. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Gul also Turkey would continue to do everything necessary to protect its borders. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Our government is in constant consultation with the Turkish military. Whatever needed is being done immediately as you see, and it will continue to be done from now on too. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Updated at 4.02pm BST [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 3.38pm BST [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The case for a Farouq al-Sharaa transition government [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Farouq al-Sharaa’s links with the Syrian regime should not rule him out of playing a role in a transition government, according to Maysaloon. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In an interview with the Guardian the blogger said: “He could be the person to hold it all together while a transition government moves things forward ... he’s seen as the civilian aspect of the regime.” [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Vice-president Sharaa’s status as a Sunni will be seen as an asset, he added. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Unfortunately there has been a sectarian element which has been unleashed so the fact that he’s Sunni could calm things. But on the plus side he did have some relationship with the regime, meaning he could be seen in a more neutral light than someone from the opposition from a different Sunni background. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Maysaloon said he was encouraged that the Syrian National Council did not reject Turkey’s endorsement of Sharaa as a transition figure. “It could be that slowly more and more people are buying into him - but it’s very early to tell.” [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Updated at 8.38am BST [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 3.04pm BST [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'Homs could fall at any moment' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Homs could fall at any moment as the Syrian army takes street after street, a resident of the central Hamidiya district told the Guardian. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Khalid Majied said the Free Syrian Army was doing little to help civilians and appeared to be on the verge of pulling out of the city. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Speaking to the Guardian's Mona Mahmood via Skype he said: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] All sorts of weapons are being used to shell our districts: explosive barrels, mortars, rockets and helicopters. The situation here is so bad, Homs might fall to the Syrian army at any moment. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The army are taking street after street, progressing towards us little by little. We can't defend ourselves any more. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] There are 14 district from Karm al-Zeitun [in the south-east] to Bab Siba'a [south-east of the centre] under the control of the Syrian army. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] For the last four days, they have been trying to get to Hamidiya [north-east of the centre] and if they continue to advance they will take Homs for sure. Three-quarters of Homs is already in the hands of the Syrian army now. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The FSA only have light weapons. They do not have the weapons to shoot tanks, and more weapons can't get in because of the siege. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Syrian army is using helicopters. Once they start to hover over the city all the rebels start to hide. The FSA around Homs are somehow lazy, they are not helping us. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We do not know why. Maybe they can't reach us because of the checkpoints or the lack of weapons. FSA fighters might pull out of here at any moment. Then the Syrian army would get inside these districts which are full of people. There are more than 1,000 families who are under the siege with the FSA. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We are in a very painful and critical situation and no one is listening or helping. We are stuck here and can do nothing. If the Syrian army manages to break through they will start to detain people and massacre civilians. There are women and kids, they might be slaughtered by the Syrian army for hosting the FSA. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We have more than 20 martyrs and many wounded people. We have people with serious injuries. They need to be taken out of the city or they will die. There are members of FSA who are wounded. If the Syrian army gets inside they will kill them in their beds. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] I used to live in Bab Siba'a district, [south-east of the centre] but my family and I left because of the heavy shooting. We now live in a house that belonged to a Christian family who fled Hamidiya district. Like many displaced families we have had to rely on food stored in Christian homes to survive. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The power and water has been cut for three months. We are living on rice and grains. There have been no supplies from outside and there is less and less in stores. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We rely on generators for power but there is an acute shortage of fuel. We get water from wells as tap water is cut most of the time. There is also a huge shortage of medical supplies. There are young men here who have limbs or an eye but there is no doctor to treat them. Doctors aren't allowed in. We have only nurses. They do what they can. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Majied sent this video purporting to show the destruction in Hamidiya district. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Updated at 4.09pm BST [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 1.30pm BST [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] More backing for a Sharaa transition government [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The UK-based Syrian blogger Maysaloon backs Turkey's idea of transition government led by the current vice-president Farouq al-Sharaa. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In his latest post he writes: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] I think that al Sharaa is a personality which can suitably keep a grip on the underlying structure of the Syrian state, and drive a wedge between Assadism on the one hand, and a nascent Syrian republic. Syria is not a country, but rather an invisible network of relations, tribes and sects which are kept together through constant negotiations, agreements and pacts. As a state, Syria has not existed for over forty years. What is therefore needed is a man who can keep a grip on this byzantine mess until such time as a proper Syrian body politic can be resurrected. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] But Maysaloon identified three obstacles that have to be overcome first: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Firstly Assad has to leave or be toppled, there is just no possibility of productive political dialogue or progress to occur so long as he is around to sabotage it; secondly the Syrian oppositions need to buy into this idea, and refrain from hamstringing the transition government; thirdly, the various armed groups that have emerged since the start of the revolution must be immediately reigned in, and either assimilated into a reformed Syrian army, or dismantled altogether. Any hope of stability in Syria rests on somebody overcoming each of these three problems. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 1.13pm BST [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Rebel commander's plea for more heavy weapons [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Colonel Qassim Saadeddine, the Free Syrian Army commander in charge of defending Homs says the rebels 'desperately need heavy weapons' to repel a major government offensive against the city. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Speaking to the Guardian's Mona Mahmood, Saadeddine said many civilians were trapped in a government operation to rout rebels from the city. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Saadeddine, one of the FSA's most senior figures, said: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] There has been heavy shelling of Khalidieh and Jurat Al-Shiyah districts by the Syrian army. They have used planes, artillery and 72 tanks to storm these districts. They have also dropped explosives in barrels from the air [see earlier]. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In the last four days the Syrian army have tried to storm these areas, and stop them becoming a hotbed for the FSA. There have been fierce clashes and many have been killed and injured, but we don't have the exact numbers. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] FSA brigades outside of Homs are trying to ease the pressure on the fighters inside these districts by attacking government checkpoints urrounding the city. But we only have light weapons, we desperately need heavy weapons to stop them. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Lot of civilians are stuck in these districts as the army will shoot any one coming out. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] There is no safe place to hide in. If anyone gets wounded, there is no medical treatment at all and it is impossible to take them out of Homs.

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] It quotes leader Abdel Basset Sayda as saying: 'We are with any solution that stops the killings in Syria and respect the ambitions of the Syrian people in what guarantees that there will be no return to dictatorship and tyranny in Syria.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] On a possible role for vice-president Farouq al-Sharaa, Sayda said: 'We have no information that he participated in the killings or gave orders but he belongs to the political leadership.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] AP adds: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Sayda said the Syrian opposition will not repeat a policy carried out in Iraq years ago when members of Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath party were forced to leave their jobs after his government was overthrown during the 2003 US-led invasion. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] De-Baathification, a concept started under the US-led coalition provisional authority which ruled Iraq after the invasion, was an Iraqi government policy of trying to purge important government jobs and positions of former mid- and high-ranking members of the Ba'ath party. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'We will not repeat the failed experience of de-Ba'athification,' Sayda said. 'We will just remove all its illegitimate privileges and officials who committed crimes will be put on trial.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'The Ba'ath party will practice its activities in accordance with the democratic process. We will not have a revenge policy and we will preserve state institutions,' he said.

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Middle East analyst Juan Cole, a supporter of Nato's action in Libya, claims the dismissal of prime minister Mustafa Abushagur does not represent a crisis. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Writing on his blog, Cole says the move is an example of parliament holding Abushagur to account for giving too much power to Islamists and not enough to Mahmoud Jibril’s National Forces Alliance. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The vote of no confidence in Abushagur was democratically accomplished and expressed genuine popular buyer’s remorse. It is no more a paralysing crisis than the Californians’ recall of Gov Gray Davis was. Unlike what you will read, the country is not politically terribly unstable, and it does have a government, which is the Congress ... [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Despite the appearance of instability created by Sunday’s vote, Libyans are proving themselves bold in their new, democratic politics. The National Congress now needs to move quickly to install a more decisive prime minister, one who can put together a government with popular support and who can rapidly address the country’s security problems.

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The SNC said the Syrian government had dispatched reinforcements to the city. DPA quoted an opposition statement as saying: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The criminal regime has dispatched extra troops to tighten the inhuman siege of the city.

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The opposition had been expected to rule out the idea because of Sharaa's closeness to the Assad regime, but SNC leader Abdel Basset Sayda told AP that the proposal would be discussed at a meeting in Qatar next week. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Sayda also said that members of Assad's ruling Baath party can play a role in Syria's political future as long as they did not participate in killings during the country's uprising and civil war. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] AP said Sayda's comments appear to be a softening of the opposition's stance that it will accept nothing less than the complete removal of the Assad regime and its inner circle.

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] AP reports: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Ban said he was 'deeply concerned' about the continued flow of arms to both the Syrian government and opposition forces, and said a 'political solution' is 'the only way out of the crisis'.

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Libyan Herald reports: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Egyptian embassy has started to evacuate Egyptian citizens from the besieged town of Bani Walid. It is estimated that there are over a thousand living and working there. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Last week Amnesty International called on the Libyan authorities to avoid unnecessary and excessive use of force in the city. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] It said it was concerned that an operation against suspected militants in Bani Walid was turning into military operation. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Updated at 9.45am BST [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 8.35am BST [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Summary [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Welcome to another week of Middle East live blogging. We start with a summary of the latest developments: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syria [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Turkey's military fired an artillery round into Syria on Sunday in immediate retaliation after a shell fired from Syria landed in the Turkish border town of Akcakale. At least six mortars could be heard being fired from Turkey. It was the fifth day in a row that Turkey had returned fire. The continued exchanges show Syria has not agreed to stay six miles from the border, as some Turkish media outlets reported on Friday. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Syrian rebels have seized a government army outpost near the Turkish border province of Hatay and a rebel flag flew over the building on Sunday, Reuters reports. The rebels took control of the three-storey white building, around a mile (1.6km) from the border on a hill overlooking the Turkish village of Guvecci on Saturday, and raised the flag of the Free Syrian Army, villagers said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Turkey has signalled that Farouq al-Sharaa, Bashar al-Assad's veteran Sunni vice-president, could replace the Syrian leader at the head of a transition government. 'Farouq al-Sharaa is a man of reason and conscience and he has not taken part in the massacres in Syria,' Turkey's foreign minister, Ahmet Davoutoglu, said in a weekend TV interview. Many in the opposition would see him as too closely associated with the regime, but Ankara's intervention shows that an important neighbour is thinking seriously about a political transition that could in theory win wide international backing at a time of mounting alarm about the crisis. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Mitt Romney is set to call for an escalation of the conflict by arming the rebels with the heavy weapons. In a foreign policy speech to be delivered later today, he will say: 'I will work with our partners to identify and organise those members of the opposition who share our values and ensure they obtain the arms they need to defeat Assad's tanks, helicopters, and fighter jets.' The Obama administration has warned Qatar and Saudi Arabia not to provide heavy weapons to the rebels in case they fall into the wrong hands, according to the New York Times. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Qatar has urged a Syrian rebel group not to carry out a threat to kill 48 Iranians seized two months ago near Damascus. Prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jasim al-Thani made the appeal following a request from Iran to secure the release of the captives. 'We hope that the matter is addressed wisely and through dialogue rather than killing hostages', he said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Hezbollah is covertly providing men and support to the Assad government and currently has about 1,500 members inside Syria, a former member of Syria's air force intelligence branch told the Times. “There are about 1,500 Hezbollah and 1,500 Iranians in Syria right now,” the officer, who defected in August, claimed. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Libya [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Libya's parliament has sacked its prime minister-elect, Mustafa Abushagur, leaving the government in disarray three months after the July elections. Abushagur's dismissal, with 125 of the 200 MPs rejecting him, underlines the problem of a congress where regionally elected members make up a majority, and where the main parties - the pro-business National Forces Alliance and the Muslim Brotherhood's Justice and Construction party - have both failed to form working majorities. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Kuwait [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • In the latest bid to end a political stand-off the emir has dissolved parliament, three months since it was reinstated by the constitutional court, al-Jazeera reports. The dissolution of the assembly has been a main demand of the opposition and the action paves the way for snap polls.

world/2011/apr/01/syria-security-forces-crackdown,2011-04-01,Syrian security forces crack down on 'Friday of Martyrs',"Security forces opened fire on demonstrators in Syria two days after President Bashar al-Assad delivered an uncompromising address aimed at restoring rigid order in a country that rarely witnesses dissent. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] At least three people were killed and scores more injured as thousands protested across the nation on a day dubbed the 'Friday of Martyrs'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The widespread presence of demonstrators on the streets of the country's towns and cities had been called for by organisers incensed by Assad's stiff address, which offered none of the concessions hoped for earlier in the week. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The southern city of Deraa was again at the vanguard of a nascent reform movement, which continues to be rallied through social media and by activists who have been galvanised by the revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Security forces were seizing mobile phones, which had been used to film clashes, to decrease the risk of further incriminating images being transferred on the internet. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The new security crackdown had been widely expected by demonstrators in the wake of Assad's speech, which was seen as a clear message that continued dissent would not be tolerated. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Several officials from the ruling Ba'ath party had pointed to new committees being set up to explore lifting the state of emergency rule which has banned dissent or political opposition for 48 years. Assad was thought likely to announce the move, and other reforms, on Wednesday. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] However, his address was instead calibrated to send a signal that he would not capitulate to a restive nation that has shown no defiance similar to the scenes of the past fortnight since an ill-fated Islamist uprising in 1982. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Assad sought to pin the blame for the unprecedented unrest in the country on a foreign plot. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] On Friday, forces opened fire in two suburbs of Damascus: Douma, where a crowd of more than 1,000 people gathered, and Kafer Souseh, where protesters were attacked by loyalists and police as they attempted to leave al-Refai mosque after prayers. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In the Kurdish north-east, protests were reported in the border town of Qamischli as well as smaller settlements including Amouda, Tell Tamer and Ras al-Ayn. Until now, Kurdish leaders have refrained from taking to the streets for fear that the government would frame Syria's uprising as a Kurdish issue. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Protesters also took to the streets chanting 'Freedom!' in Deraa, Latakia, Banias and Homs. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A witness in the Damascus area of Barzeh reported security forces breaking up a gathering there. 'Worshippers shouted 'Freedom, freedom, freedom' until more than 500 security forces broke them up,' he told the Guardian. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Observers said the numbers were uncertain but showed growing unrest. 'The protesters were mainly in small groups but this is to be expected,' said Wissam Tarif, a human rights researcher in Syria. 'They are spreading all over the country. Each week different towns and cities are going out.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Razan Zeitoneh, a human rights activist in Damascus said: 'The regime has made it clear that it will use violence to end this and it prepared for this with bus loads of security forces but still demonstrators went out.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The protests may be a sign that the regime's gamble on inducing fear has backfired. Much of Assad's domestic support has traditionally been linked to his image as a reformer. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The continued stand-off between the government and protesters has caused anxiety in Syria to rise. It has also provoked a spike in sectarian tensions, after the government suggested incitement between sects was a factor in the uprising. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] However, Syria's unrest has no discernible sectarian overtones and protesters in Kafer Souseh chanted 'The Syrian people are one'. But activists said fear is growing among Assad's Alawite minority, an offshoot of Shia Islam. Eyewitnesses said in one predominantly Alawite neighbourhood of Damascus a checkpoint for entry area was in force. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In the wake of Assad's speech, several western residents have reported being harassed or questioned by groups of unidentified men and security forces. On Friday the US issued a travel advisory warning against all but essential travel to Syria and advised citizens in the country to consider leaving. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Two Reuters journalists remain in detention, but Mohamed Radwan, an Egyptian-American accused by the authorities of selling information abroad, was released. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Mosques have so far been the focus of Friday protests, but activists say they are rapidly developing online and offline networks to mobilise people elsewhere.

world/2011/mar/28/syria-troops-fire-anti-government-protesters,2011-03-28,Syrian troops fire teargas at protesters in Deraa,"Security forces in Syria are reported to have fired teargas and fired shots in the air as anti-government protests flared again in the southern city of Deraa. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The unrest followed clashes in Latakia over the weekend in which at least 12 people died, and promises by the authorities to lift emergency laws restricting public gatherings and allowing arrests on the grounds of national security. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A witness told Associated Press that forces had fired teargas as up to 4,000 people protested in Deraa. He said security forces fired teargas at first. He also heard gunfire, although it appeared guns were being fired in the air. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A witness told Reuters news agency demonstrators had converged on a main square in the city, chanting 'We want dignity and freedom' and 'No to emergency laws'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Security forces have struggled to deal with unrest in the southern city and other centres but authorities have held out the prospect of decisions that would 'please the Syrian people' in the next two days. An announcement by president Bashar al-Assad was promised by the vice-president Farouq al-Shara, speaking on Lebanese Hezbollah's al-Manar television. There were no details. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Turkey's prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said he had spoken to the Syrian president twice over the weekend urging reforms. 'They told us they were working on political parties … we hope these measures are actually implemented rather than remaining promises,' Erdogan said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'We did not receive a negative answer when we urged Mr Assad to listen to the voice of people. I hope he makes the announcement today or tomorrow … It is impossible for us to remain silent in the face of these events, we have a 800km-long border with Syria.'",James Meikle and agencies,The Guardian
world/2011/aug/09/syria-protest-troops-attack-democracy-demonstrators,2011-08-09,Syria protests: Troops renew attacks on pro-democracy demonstrators,"Syrian security forces were reported to have launched another wave of violence against pro-democracy protesters on Tuesday as President Bashar al-Assad rejected a Turkish appeal to change tack or meet the fate of Libya's Muammar Gaddafi. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Human rights groups recorded at least 40 civilians dead on the day that Ahmed Davutoglu, Turkey's foreign minister, met the Syrian leader to issue what was billed as a 'final warning' to end the five-month crackdown, estimated by the US as having claimed 2,000 victims. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syrian's state news agency, Sana, quoted Assad as telling Davutoglu that he would 'relentlessly fight terrorist groups' – the terminology used by Damascus to describe anti-regime protests. Davutoglu returned to Ankara without speaking to reporters but was expected to hold a press conference later. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Activists quoted by al-Arabiya TV said 17 people had been killed on the third day of an assault on the Deir Ezzor, close to the border where many people have links to Iraq and Saudi Arabia. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Syrian National Organisation for Human Rights reported 26 people killed and dozens wounded when troops backed by tanks and armoured vehicles stormed Soran and other villages north of Hama, target of a 10-day assault to crush protests. Syrian state media said government forces were withdrawing from the city. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Syrian Revolution Co-ordinating Union said the bodies of two sisters, aged six and 11, were among five brought to a hospital in nearby Tibet al-Imam. Four people were also killed in Binnish, near the border with Turkey. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'The whole town has been joining in night rallies against Assad after Ramadan prayers,' a resident said. A member of the Local Co-ordination Committees told the Guardian more than 20 tanks and armoured vehicles had entered the town at 4am, with forces shooting, raiding houses and making arrests, including of teenage boys. 'This town has been protesting in huge numbers,' said the activist, named Odai. 'That's why they [the regime] want to put it down.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Soldiers entering houses had stolen money and jewellery. Similar reports have come from other cities including Homs. Tanks were reported in the northern town of Idlib. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] As the violence continued, it was rumoured that Ali Habib, the former Syrian defence minister, had been found dead after being replaced on Monday. But sources in Damacsus insisted that Habib, like the Assads a member of the minority Alawite sect, was unwell but alive. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In the past high-profile Syrians who have fallen foul of the regime have been killed or reportedly taken their own lives in mysterious circumstances. True or not, the story seemed symptomatic of a febrile atmosphere and heightened intense speculation about the inner workings of the Assad regime. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Opposition sources said they were worried that the new defence minister, Daoud Rajah, had been chosen to drive a wedge between his own Christian community and the country's Sunni majority. The appointment was also seen as reflecting possible disagreements the president and his brother Maher, who in effect commands the elite fourth division and has been overseeing the security crackdown. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Turkish officials protested at suggestions Davutoglu was simply delivering a message from the US, after briefing by the state department in Washington about a conversation between him and the secretary of state, Hillary Clinton. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Assad's diplomatic isolation deepened this week after Saudi Arabia led Kuwait and Bahrain in recalling their ambassadors from Damascus in protest at the repression. Diplomats say the US and Britain were instrumental in pressing Arab states to break their silence and change tack. King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia called the Syrian regime 'a killing machine'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Emissaries from India, Brazil and South Africa are also due in Damascus to appeal for an end to the crackdown and the introduction of genuine democratic reforms. All three have so far been reticent about stronger UN action against Syria. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Activists in Damascus said they were drawing hope from the escalation of protests and the ratcheting up of international pressure on Assad. But none said they could envisage the way in which the regime would fall. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Human Rights Watch said on Tuesday the UN security council should press Syria to comply with its demand to end attacks against peaceful protesters. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'President Bashar al-Assad needs to hear loud and clear that the security council will not tolerate such contempt for its united call for Syria to change course,' said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said 'precedence should be given to ending the violence and continuing efforts to effect profound political and socioeconomic changes in Syria without delay'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syria has banned foreign media and restricted local coverage that strays from the official party line, which states the regime is fighting thugs and religious extremists who are acting out a foreign conspiracy.

world/2011/aug/02/syria-deaths-protests-crackdown,2011-08-02,Syrian death toll rises in crackdown,"Syrian security forces continued to attack civilian protesters in the central city of Hama and in Damascus as the EU imposed sanctions on key regime figures and the UN struggled to agree to condemn the violence unleashed by President Bashar al-Assad. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Activists said 21 people had been killed across the country on Monday and seven more on Tuesday, bringing to at least 140 the number of fatalities since Sunday, when the government launched an offensive in Hama on the eve of the Ramadan fast. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Italy announced that it was recalling its ambassador from the Syrian capital for consultations, but this was not part of a move co-ordinated across the EU. The Foreign Office said Britain's envoy would stay in Damascus to monitor the situation and expose Syrian deception. The US embassy said several of its diplomats were also leaving the country. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In Damascus gunfire was heard as 20,000 people attended a funeral in the Arbeen area. Film from Hama, where holding public funerals is dangerous, showed freshly-dug graves in a public park opposite the Sirjawi mosque. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] New sanctions agreed by the EU targeted Syria's defence minster, Ali Habib Mahmoud, and three top security officials linked directly to the repression. Mohammed Makhklouf, Assad's uncle, was also subject to a travel ban and assets freeze already imposed on 30 regime figures. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Diplomats described a 'positive atmosphere' during Monday's consultations by the UN security council in New York, with 'more room to manoeuvre' because of a softening of Russia's position. Russia and China have previously refused to condemn Syria, partly because of anger over the way the UN action on Libya paved the way for Nato intervention and a policy of regime change. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] But officials said it was unclear whether this would produce a formal statement or a fully-fledged UN resolution that could be vetoed by any one of the five permanent members of the council. Russia said it was not against a resolution but would oppose the imposition of sanctions or other 'pressures' on Syria, a long-standing ally. The bloody events in Hama have a special and deeply sinister resonance in Syria because many thousands died there when Assad's father Hafez sent in tanks to crush an Islamist uprisng in 1982. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In Washington, meanwhile, three senators said they would introduce legislation to ramp up pressure on the Assad regime by penalising foreign companies that do business in Syria's energy sector. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Foreign journalists and independent human rights groups are largely banned from Syria but information about the unrest continues to flow freely. Film clips posted on YouTube showed a funeral procession for a man killed in the northern town of Idlib.

world/2011/jul/31/syria-hama-crackdown-tanks-protests,2011-08-01,Syria: 100 die in crackdown as Assad sends in his tanks,"Syria's uprising faced one of its defining moments when President Bashar al-Assad followed in his father's footsteps and sent in tanks to crush protests in the central city of Hama, killing up to 100 people and triggering a new wave of international outrage. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The National Organisation for Human Rights said that in total 136 people had been killed in Hama and three other towns. Activists described a massacre after armoured units ended a month-long siege to smash through makeshift barricades around the city just after dawn on the eve of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] International media are still largely banned from Syria but citizen journalists ensured that the scale and brutality of the crackdown was visible to the outside world. Video clips posed on YouTube showed unarmed civilians taking cover from shelling and heavy machine-gun fire as hospitals struggled to cope with 200 casualties by mid-morning. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Bodies lay scattered on the streets, residents reported. 'They started shooting with heavy machine guns at civilians, at the young men protecting the barricades,' Omar Habal, a local activist, told the Guardian. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syria, with a population of 23 million, is experiencing the bloodiest days yet of the Arab spring, which began with the revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt. Assad, once hailed as a modernising reformist, has ruled since 2000. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The government said 'armed gangs' with automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades were vandalising public and private property in Hama, attacking police stations, erecting barricades and burning tyres. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Hama, known as a conservative stronghold of the country's Sunni Muslim majority, has a special resonance in Syria as the scene of a notorious massacre in 1982 when the Ba'ath regime crushed an Islamist uprising that challenged the rule of the president's father, Hafez al-Assad. At least 10,000 were killed then. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Sunday's crackdown involved troops and security agents accompanied by busloads of irregular militiamen known as Shabiha (Ghosts) who belong to the same Alawite minority as the Assad family. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The official Sana news agency said two security force members were killed in Hama and three in Deir Ezzor, on the border with Iraq, where government armoured units continued an assault over the weekend. Violence was also reported from parts of Damascus and the southern city of Deraa, where activists said three people participating in a rally to support Hama were shot dead by security forces. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Hama residents told Reuters that army snipers had climbed on to the roofs of the state-owned electricity company and the main prison, while tank shells were falling at the rate of four a minute in and around the north of the city. Electricity and water supplies to the main neighbourhoods had been cut off, a tactic used regularly by the Syrian military when storming towns to crush protests. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Habal described people walking towards tanks armed only with wooden bats, steel bars or stones. 'It's a massacre. They want to break Hama before the month of Ramadan,' an eyewitness who identified himself as Ahmed, told the Associated Press by telephone. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Al-Arabiya TV reported that some soldiers had refused to fire on protesters and had joined them. But unlike Libya, Syria has not yet experienced any high-level defections from the military. Film clips showed corpses in mortuaries, clouds of smoke, the sound of explosions and gunfire, and demonstrators chanting 'Allahu Akbar' (God is great). [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Britain condemned the 'appalling' onslaught, long anticipated by the Syrian opposition. 'Such action against civilians who have been protesting peacefully in large numbers in the city for a number of weeks has no justification,' said William Hague, the foreign secretary. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Speaking to the BBC from Damascus, a spokesman for the US embassy described 'full-on warfare by the Syrian government on its own people … That's the armed gang that is striking terror into the hearts of the people.' The US ambassador has been told he cannot leave the city after enraging the government by paying a high-profile visit to Hama last month. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] President Barack Obama said he was 'appalled' by the brutality of the Syrian government and described reports from Hama as 'horrifying'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Precise casualty figures were unclear but they rose throughout the day. The local co-ordination committee, which organises and monitors anti-government protests, said it had the names of 49 civilians who had died in the onslaught on Hama. By nightfall the numbers were nudging 100 for Hama alone. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Hama has been a focus of anti-regime protests since early June, when security forces shot dead at least 70 people. Since then it has fallen out of government control, with protesters holding the streets and government forces conducting overnight raids from outside the city. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] But apart from ritual condemnation, the latest bloodletting looks unlikely to trigger any significant international response, given the sharp divisions among the veto-wielding five permanent members of the UN security council. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Germany, which held the rotating presidency of the council until midnight on Sunday, requested that the body meet on Monday to discuss the violence. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Limited sanctions on key officials imposed by the US and EU have been shrugged off by the regime. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'It's incredible to consider that since March the regime has slaughtered over 1,500 people, arrested thousands, tortured people to death, and yet the UN security council has yet to issue a resolution,' said Chris Doyle of the Council for Arab-British Understanding. 'Russia, China and other countries such as Brazil should have to explain their appalling positions.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] An activist group, Avaaz, said last week Syrian forces had killed 1,634 people in the course of their crackdown during four and a half months of protest, while at least 2,918 had disappeared. A further 26,000 had been arrested, many of them beaten and tortured, and 12,617 remained in detention, it said.","Ian Black, Middle East editor and Nour Ali in Damascus",The Guardian

At least 15 protesters are known to have been shot dead on Wednesday and scores more injured. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In a sign that the Syrian regime is using a brutal crackdown rather than concessions to quell protests, security forces opened fire on people in three separate incidents, according to human rights activists. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] At 1am on Wednesday morning, at least six people were killed when security forces opened fire on protesters surrounding the Omari mosque, after cutting electricity and communications to the site that has become the focus of demonstrations. During the day, several were reported shot as they attended funerals of victims of the mosque shooting. Syrian security forces later opened fire on scores of young people from surrounding towns as they marched towards Deraa, offering support to the protests, activists said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'The government promised it would consider its citizens' demands, and then it decided to attack them,' said Mohammed al-Abdullah, a prominent activist in exile in the US who is in close contact with the Deraa protesters. 'These were fully prepared and full-scale attacks.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] According to human rights organisations, the government has also rounded up scores of demonstrators, activists and journalists. Yesterday, Mazen Darwish, the head of the Syrian Centre for Media and Freedom of Expression, which was officially closed down by the authorities in 2009, was arrested. Darwish, who has been commenting on the protests in the media, was briefly detained after a protest on Wednesday last week calling for the release of political prisoners. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Amnesty International said it knows of 93 people who were arrested between 8 and 23 March who remain detained in unknown locations. It said the real number of arrests was likely to be 'considerably higher'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] France, which has led efforts in the past four years to bring Damascus back into the international fold, became the latest in a string of governments and organisations to condemn the violence. It called for political reforms 'without delay'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] But observers said the window for negotiations and reforms is quickly closing. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Leaders in Deraa had issued a range of demands to the government, including the release of political prisoners from the area, the freedom to buy and sell property without permission of local security forces and the dismissal of the governor of Deraa. So far, only the last demand has been met. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'By using such disproportionate violence against its own citizens, neither the government nor the people can be expected to negotiate,' said Abdullah, adding that without talks there was no clear solution to the violence. 'I am scared because I don't know how this will end. I fear escalating anger will lead to an evermore brutal crackdown.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syria's government has continued to blame the violence on outside perpetrators. it called the shootings at the Omari mosque the work of 'armed gangs'. Activists dispute the claims. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Despite protesters not yet calling for President Bashar al-Assad to step down, the unrest is the biggest domestic challenge to the regime since the 1970s.

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Abu Hassan al-Homsi, a doctor at a makeshift clinic in Khaldiyeh district of Homs, said he had treated a dozen wounded from the latest onslaught. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Local Co-ordination Committees activist network said mortars began slaimming into Khaldiyeh, Bab Sbaa and Khader districts of the city early on Saturday. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The shelling comes amid a standoff between the government and the Red Cross, which says authorities have prevented its convoy from delivering badly needed food, medical supplies and blankets to thousands of people still stranded in Baba Amr, the rebel-held district of Homs that was overrun by troops on Thursday. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Despite receiving permission from the government to send a convoy with seven truckloads of aid into Baba Amr, the Red Cross was prevented from entering the neighbourhood, an action it described as 'unacceptable'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The refusal to allow the convoy in to treat and evacuate the wounded came as the organisation announced that the Syrian authorities had handed over the bodies of Marie Colvin and Remi Ochlik, who were killed in an attack on a press centre in Baba Amr over a week ago. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'We have the bodies of two journalists, Marie Colvin and Remi Ochlik. They are being taken by ambulance of the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, accompanied by the ICRC, and are heading to Damascus,' chief spokeswoman Carla Haddad told Reuters in Geneva. 'They were handed over in Homs by the Syrian authorities.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The French journalist Edith Bouvier, who was badly wounded in the same attack, arrived back in France on Friday with her colleague William Daniels. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Commenting on the halting of the convoy, Red Cross president, Jakob Kellenberger, said: 'It is unacceptable that people who have been in need of emergency assistance for weeks have still not received any help. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'We are staying in Homs tonight in the hope of entering Baba Amr in the very near future. In addition, many families have fled Baba Amr, and we will help them as soon as we possibly can. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'We reiterate the appeal we made several days ago, for a daily two-hour halt in the fighting to allow humanitarian assistance,' added Kellenberger. 'The humanitarian situation was very serious then and it is worse now.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Red Cross had hoped to bring urgent medical and food aid to civilians trapped in Baba Amr after fighters with the Free Syrian Army announced on Thursday that they were withdrawing from their positions. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Reports from other opposition-held neighbourhoods in the city of one million suggested that fighters may also have pulled back from their positions there. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Anti-Assad activists have accused Syrian troops of burning houses, arresting all males over the age of 12 and of extrajudicial killings, including the alleged beheadings of 17 men captured after the suburb's fall. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Bassel Fouad, a Syrian activist who fled to Lebanon from Baba Amr two days ago, said a colleague there told him that troops and pro-government gunmen known as shabiha were conducting house-to-house raids. 'The situation is worse than terrible inside Baba Amr,' he said. 'Shabiha are entering homes and setting them on fire.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] His colleague said the gunmen lined 10 men up early on Friday and shot them dead outside a government co-operative that sells subsidised food. He said Syrian forces were detaining anyone over the age of 14 in the three-storey building. 'They begin at the start of a street and enter and search house after house,' he said. 'Then they start with another street.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] None of his claims could be independently verified. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'There's no resistance here,' one activist in the northern neighbourhood of Khalidiyeh told the Guardian yesterday. 'There is only shelling and bombing.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The situation in Baba Amr itself was described by an onlooker. 'Today the Syrian army are in control. There are a lot of wounded who could not flee. The Syrian army is firing against anything they can find in front of them. They are arresting any young men they find.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In other parts of the city, such as Khalidiyeh, residents said the fighters who remained were low on ammunition: 'We have members of the FSA here, but they have a small amount of ammunition and they are trying to use every bullet against the right target.' He accused the army of murdering a family in Baba Amr, and added: 'The Syrian army are arresting any man they find from 14 years upwards.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syria has faced mounting international criticism over its bloody crackdown on the uprising, which started with peaceful protests but has become increasingly militarised. The UN has estimated that more than 7,500 people have been killed in the past year. Activists put the death toll at over 8,000. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] France said on Friday it is closing its embassy in Syria. The US and Britain have already closed their embassies. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] French president Nicolas Sarkozy called the events in Syria a 'scandal', adding that the European Council 'condemned in the harshest terms what is happening in Syria'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Ambassador Eric Chevallier had only recently returned to Damascus after being recalled to Paris for consultations. He was sent back to help try to get Bouvier and Daniels out of Syria. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The west has stepped up its criticism of Assad's regime amid mounting reports of atrocities by security forces. The US has called for Assad to step down and Hillary Clinton has said he could be considered a war criminal. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Russia's prime minister Vladimir Putin criticised the west on Friday for backing the Syrian opposition against the government, saying it had fuelled the conflict. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] But his foreign ministry made it clear it will not be able to stop other countries from launching a military intervention if they try to do so without UN approval. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Putin called for both Syrian government and opposition forces to pull out of besieged cities to end the bloodshed, adding that western refusal to make that demand of Assad's opponents has encouraged them to keep fighting. 'Do they want Assad to pull out his forces so the opposition moves right in?' he said at a meeting with editors of western newspapers in remarks carried by state television. 'Is it a balanced approach?' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Activist groups said protesters who took to the streets in towns across Syria on Friday were met with teargas, gunfire and mass arrests. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 10 people were killed in the town of Rastan near Homs when a mortar landed near marchers. The Local Co-ordination Committees of Syria said 16 were killed in the same event, among 52 reported dead nationwide.

world/2012/jul/19/syrian-crisis-fuels-volatile-relations,2012-07-19,Syrian crisis fuels already volatile relations in Middle East,"Uncertainty about Syria's fate is jangling nerves across the Middle East as events conspire to threaten violence and instability far beyond the country's borders. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Israel's swift accusation that Hezbollah and Iran were behind the suicide bombing of a tourist bus in Bulgaria on Wednesday was a stark reminder of a separate but closely related battle between the two most powerful states in the region: Iran's nuclear programme, Israel's alleged assassination of Iranian scientists, and Tehran's close alliance with Damascus make for a dangerous and volatile combination. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The accusation by Syrian state media that the Gulf state of Qatar is faking scenes of mayhem in Damascus was evidence of the belief – whether delusion or propaganda – that President Bashar al-Assad is facing a sinister Arab-western conspiracy to overthrow him, rather than a popular uprising in the spirit of the Arab spring. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] It has seemed obvious for some time that Assad's days are numbered, as the rebellion has gathered strength and diplomacy has foundered on divisions between the west and Russia. But even after the sensational assassination of three of his closest security chiefs it is no clearer how much longer he can survive – and what the human cost will be before he goes. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The risks of spillover are growing. Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan worry about refugees streaming across their borders. Jordan is especially concerned about inflows of more Palestinians, who could tip its own fragile ethnic balance. It also fears the growing influence of its own Muslim Brotherhood if Assad is toppled. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Israel, the undisputed and nuclear-armed regional superpower, is concerned about a possible diversionary attack on the Golan Heights, though its military intelligence chief noted this week that Assad has moved troops away from there to protect Damascus. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] It also fears the theft of – or accidental damage to – Syria's chemical warfare arsenal. In the worst case it fears such weapons could be transferred to Hezbollah in Lebanon or fall into the hands of jihadi-type groups. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Other alarming scenarios involve acts of desperation by a regime in its death throes. Hezbollah, armed and financed by Iran and helped by Syria, has thousands of rockets it could use to attack deep inside Israel, though the lesson of the 2006 war is that Israel would not hesitate to lay waste to Lebanon in response. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Hassan Nasrallah, the Hezbollah leader, made clear his support for Assad, and on the sixth anniversary of the last war he warned of a 'big surprise' if Israel dared to strike. Nasrallah also praised the dead Syrian generals, describing them as 'comrades in arms to the resistance and comrades in the [struggle] against the enemy'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] No surprise, however, that Ehud Barak, Israel's defence minister, sounded so pleased with what he described as the severe blow suffered by the 'radical axis' of Assad, Nasrallah and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran. Dispelling any doubt, Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, called Iran 'the no 1 exporter of terror in the world'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Beyond any immediate risks, Syria's neighbours also worry about what will happen next. The fragmented nature of the anti-Assad opposition does not inspire confidence. The Syrian National Council may be tainted by too close an association with the west, Qatar and the Saudis, and the dominance within it of the Muslim Brotherhood. It is also unclear whether it can impose its will on the Free Syrian Army, let alone on radical smaller groups with a radical agenda. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] It is hard to imagine any negotiations between the regime and its enemies while Assad and his inner circle remain in power. That remains the centrepiece of UN envoy Kofi Annan's near moribund peace plan – the only way to de-escalate the crisis. It suffered another perhaps fatal blow at the UN on Thursday. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Further afield, Iran is naturally concerned about the loss of its closest Arab ally – a relationship that dates back to the 1979 revolution. Tehran has flatly denied that it was involved in the killing of five Israeli tourists in Bulgaria. Still, its fingerprints have been easily visible in recent attacks on Israeli targets in Georgia, India and Thailand. Its relationship with Hezbollah is a source or pride. It has reason to believe that its scientists have been murdered by Israel's agents. Israel may decide to make do with a political response. If it takes revenge it will be adding fuel to a highly combustible regional mixture. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Chemical weapons fears [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Alarm bells are ringing over Syria's chemical weapons arsenal, believed to be the biggest in the Middle East, because of fears it could be damaged in battle or fall into the hands of terrorists taking advantage of the weakening grip of the Assad regime. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] According to the New York Times, the US and Israel have discussed whether Israel should take action, though officials in Jerusalem told the Guardian last week that safeguards were being put in place by the dedicated Syrian military unit in charge. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Jordan is also said to have been involved in plans to seize Syrian chemical weapons facilities if the situation deteriorates further. King Abdullah said there was a risk they could be seized by al-Qaida. 'We are obviously trying to look for a political solution … if some of those chemical stockpiles were to fall into unfriendly hands,' he told CNN. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syria's arsenal includes mustard gas and deadly nerve agents such as Tabun, Sarin and VX. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Claims by a senior defector that Assad would use them to fight rebels have been treated with scepticism, not least because of echoes of the 2003 Iraq war, when Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction (the ostensible justification for the US-led invasion) turned out to be non-existent.

world/2013/jan/27/syria-rebels-consolidate-near-latakia,2013-01-27,"Even in Assad's coastal retreat, the war has come and the bombs are dropping","Local people describe it as a distant growl, an ever-present rumble, just to the north. A reminder that war is now at their doorstep. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] It has been this way for two months in Latakia. The port city had managed to ride out Syria's civil war, seemingly content in the knowledge that whatever was happening in Hama to the south-east, or Idlib a little further north, an army stood between its gates and its foes. Not any more. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The spectre of war is now a reality here in the staunch core of the regime heartland, as much as it is in the rebellious and ravaged Sunni cities to the east. The shells that crunch most hours into the nearby countryside have not yet arrived. But the fear that pervades the communities on the fringes of Latakia is now spreading around the city known throughout the country as the government's stronghold, and possibly its last redoubt. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'We are afraid, very, very afraid,' said Loubna, a final-year university student and resident of the city. 'For so long the regime has been saying we will be safe here. That nothing will happen to us. Nothing can happen to us. But people are leaving, people are dying. Death is so near.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] As the insurgency has blazed into nearly every corner of Syria, Latakia has stood resolute as a distant and almost unobtainable target, protected by some of the Syrian military's most formidable forces and diehard militias. Business still ticks over. With the engine room of the country's ecomomy – Aleppo – having ground to a halt, Latakia has stepped partly into the breach, all the while remaining the playground of Syria's wealthy elite and a refuge for its establishment. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] President Bashar al-Assad has a palace on the coast and many of his generals keep villas here. Members of Syria's fractured opposition, as well as western states calling for Assad to be ousted, often claim that Latakia will be a last redoubt for key regime figures and the Alawite sect, from which much of Syria's power base is drawn. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Over the past two months, the influx of Alawites from the increasingly besieged villages to the north is slowly transforming the city into just such a sanctuary. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'The wolves are at the door,' said an Alawite refugee in the Turkish border town of Reyhanli. 'Even Qardaha is not safe any more.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Qardaha is the ancestral home of the Assad family. It is where the late dictator and architect of Syria's uncompromising social and military doctrine, Hafez al-Assad, is buried, in an immaculately kept shrine maintained by an honour guard. It was never supposed to be under threat of attack. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] But 12km to the north, in the mountains of Jebel al-Krud, a giant plateau that soars above Latakia and Tartous to the south, rebel groups now have Qardaha in their sites. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The frontline of the war for the cultural plain, and regime's heart, is several kilometres below them. Warplanes swarm here like mosquitoes. After dark, it is the helicopters' turn to roam above the ink-black plateau, the distant whump of their rotor blades a harbinger of the spine-chilling terror that inevitably follows, in the form of large barrels of explosives pushed from their open doors. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'We can tell when they're falling now,' said a young, almost nonchalant rebel who had returned from the frontline that carves jaggedly between lush green undergrowth and the crumbling remains of a grey concrete village. 'They are bombing Salma [a frontline village] at the moment, because they think that the battle for Qardaha will be launched from there. We're more interested in Latakia.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] So, too, are jihadist groups, first among them the al-Qaida-aligned Jabhat al-Nusra, who are now congregating around 20km north of Latakia and making plans to advance. 'There are around 300-400 of them,' said a rebel commander in the hills not far away. 'They have their eyes on the gold and jewellery stores. They are more interested in here than in Idlib, or Aleppo.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Not all those under fire are seeking refuge in Latakia. Some families, the few that remain in the battleground villages of Jebel al-Krud, are trying to make their way north to Turkey. In one such village, the custodian of the town's Orthodox church offered the Observer a tour of the ancient stone building that she so clearly cherished. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] There was little in the way of an oral history, though. She slowly made her way to the centre of the church and, before she had spoken a word, broke down in tears of unrestrained grief. A Muslim neighbour offered her an arm of comfort, but her tears would not stop. Later, she said that her face had recently appeared on a US television network and that she could no longer travel to Latakia without fear of persecution. Falling foul of the regime is a constant dread among those on the move, and especially for those who stay behind. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Abu Yousef and his two sons have chosen to remain in their mixed Sunni-Christian village. They are one of only 10 families to do so. A church sits alongside a mosque here. Both have been damaged by shelling. 'We hope it will work out, we really do,' he said as he stood on a hillside, Latakia around 20km behind him and the sound of a nearby battle reverberating. 'It's up to God. It's out of our control.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Conversations with Syria's newest refugees are often snatched and guarded. Trust is hard won, if it's obtained at all. Eyes are averted. Contact is perfunctory. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] War has settled into an eerie rhythm in this part of Syria. While rebels are now at Latakia's northern doorstep, an advance 20km south to the heart of the city will take significant planning and manpower, perhaps more than the rebel army, drawn largely from the rural poor, can muster. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] An invasion in any sort of formation is well beyond the opposition army's capabilities, even with a reorganisation of the fragmented leadership's command into groups tasked with coordinating and acting strategically. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'It won't be fast and it won't be easy,' said a leader of the rebels' military council, who not long ago owned large and lucrative quarries in the Idlib hinterland. His business interests have since been confiscated and he claimed to be as penniless as the defector sitting cross-legged on the barren floor next to him, a private in the Syrian army who fled his post in Jisr al-Shughour last month. 'I don't care what it takes,' the officer said. 'As long as we beat al-Qaida to Latakia.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In this room, a former Syrian army outpost, and in others like it in the northern countryside of Syria, the working theory is that Assad and his senior officials are keeping a corridor open to Latakia from the south-east – a line that traces the Alawite heartland of the country, past Hama, then Homs, and ending in Damascus. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'They are preparing for a worst-case scenario,' one rebel offered as an explanation. 'If it goes badly for the Alawites, they will want a country of their own.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'Do you think it's going badly for them?' another man asked. 'This is going to continue for another year. They will wear us down.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Another man joined in, struggling to be heard above a now increasing din of voices. 'Another year, we'll all be dead. That is too much. May God punish Bashar and all his family.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The conversation was now drowned by shouting. Goals and realities seemed almost irreconcilable at this point in the group's battle planning. There seems little way forward except more of the same grinding, miserable suffering that has come to characterise the war in the north. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'But we must get it together. We just must,' the rebel leader finally piped up. 'You in the west ask us why it is going like this and then you refuse to help us. Latakia is a price worth paying. There is no way Bashar can win the war if he loses there.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We spoke by phone to a merchant in Latakia on Saturday. He runs restaurants on the coastline and an import business through the nearby port. 'Jet skis are on the ocean and people are smoking [water pipes],' he said. 'Yes, there are planes and bombs in the distance. But for now it's our new reality. We are getting used to it. If they get any closer, we'll leave.'",Martin Chulov,The Guardian
world/2012/feb/26/syria-referendum-constitution-homs-shelling,2012-02-27,Syria votes on new constitution as shelling of Homs continues,"Syrians have taken part in a referendum to clear the way for multi-party elections that could see Bashar al-Assad entrenched as president until 2028, in a vote widely dismissed by the opposition as a figleaf for reform. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Turnout appeared to be mixed across the country, with voter participation being noticeably higher in areas where Assad still has support, such as Damascus and the commercial hub of Aleppo. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] As voters cast their ballots elsewhere, rockets were again fired into Syria's third city of Homs, where civilians in rebel-held areas have been trapped for more than three weeks by shellfire. Nationwide, more than 50 people have been killed each day for at least the past week, according to local activists and civilian journalists. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] At least 59 civilians and soldiers were killed on Sunday. At least 12 civilians were killed in bombardment of the Baba Amr and al-Khalidiya districts of Homs, while three people were killed when security forces opened fire on a demonstration in Damascus, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The British-based observatory said 21 other civilians were killed elsewhere, while rebels forces killed 23 members of the security forces. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Officials in Damascus said voting was lower in unstable areas. The result of the referendum, to change the constitution and authorise political parties other than the Ba'ath party, appears to be a foregone conclusion, with most of those who turned out likely to vote yes. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The referendum is held up as a centrepiece of Assad's reforms, which were drafted as a response to what has been a sustained challenge to the totalitarian state that he and his father before him have ruled for more than 40 years. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] It would mean the Ba'ath party would no longer have a monopoly on political and social life in Syria. Opposition groups would, in law at least, be free to stand independently in future elections. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] But a constitutional change limiting a president's maximum term to 14 years would not be applied retrospectively, meaning Assad could still serve two more terms from the next election, likely to be held in 2014. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The referendum has been roundly dismissed by opposition groups and by the west, which insist Assad has lost all legitimacy. Turkey said the ongoing crackdown on dissent belied talk of reform. The White House described the referendum as meaningless. The German foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, said it was a farce. 'Sham votes cannot contribute to a solution of the crisis. Assad needs to put an end to the violence and clear the way for a political transition,' he said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A Friends of Syria conference, which was attended by more than 70 states in Tunis over the weekend, denounced the vote as designed to create a veneer of change while the lethal assault on opposition groups continued unabated. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] US secretary of state Hillary Clinton, who was in Tunis, indicated that the US objection to the arming of those rebels who are in open revolt had not changed, despite the remarks of several congressmen. She said military intervention would be perilous. 'I think there's every possibility of a civil war,' she told the BBC. 'Outside intervention would not prevent that. It would probably expedite it. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'We have a very dangerous set of actors in the region: al-Qaida, Hamas and those who are on our terrorist list claiming to support the opposition. You have many Syrians more worried about what could come next.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Vladimir Putin, Russia's prime minister, also spoke against the idea: 'I very much hope the US and other countries ... do not try to set a military scenario in motion without sanction from the UN security council.' Russia and China have vetoed such security council approval. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A senior Hamas figure told the Associated Press that its leader, Khaled Mashaal, had moved from Syria to Qatar. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Efforts to evacuate the wounded from Baba Amr, including two western reporters and the bodies of two colleagues, have not succeeded, despite urgent pleas from Europe. The International Committee of the Red Cross has been trying since the deaths last Wednesday of Sunday Times correspondent Marie Colvin and French photographer Rémi Ochlik to get scores of wounded out of Syria to hospitals in Lebanon. Talks broke down several times over the weekend. Some observers said the delay was caused by a lack of trust. The Free Syrian Army was said to have rejected two ambulances sent into Baba Amr, partly because it could not guarantee where the wounded would be taken. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Kate Conroy, wife of injured photographer Paul Conroy, said that, with reluctance, she could appreciate the Foreign Office view that it was too difficult to provide an escort to help with his rescue. Nonetheless, she would like it 'if somebody in that embassy was to say: 'Forget protocol, I'm going to get them out.'' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Essential services have collapsed in rebel-held districts of Homs over a four- month siege that has trapped up to 20,000 people. Besieged neighbourhoods claim they are get electricity each day for only a few hours a day, and are desperately low on food and water. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Baba Amr, a hub for the Free Syrian Army, had largely been left to its own devices until an artillery assault began 24 days ago. It has since been reduced to a series of ghettos that regime forces have yet to enter, though local activists expect a ground assault at any time.",Martin Chulov in Beirut,The Guardian

John Ging, operations director for the UN humanitarian office, said the UN was also forecasting that the number of refugees fleeing the violence will increase to 700,000 by early 2013. Ging said: “People need to be aware of just how desperate the situation is inside Syria for the people there ... It’s just getting a lot worse very rapidly for the ordinary people.” [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Some 11,000 Syrians have fled the country in the past 24 hours. Panos Moumtzis, the UN refugee agency's coordinator for the region, told reporters in Geneva that 9,000 Syrians fled to Turkey, while 1,000 went into Jordan and 1,000 into Lebanon just in one day. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • A top UN official has urged European countries to do more to tackle the Syrian refugee crisis and warned that Turkey 'stretched to the limit' with the numbers of people fleeing the violence. Erika Feller, assistant commissioner for refugees at the UNHCR, told the Guardian that the number of refugees being allowed to cross into Turkey had to be staggered because there was no more capacity to cope with the increasing numbers. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • There have been continued clashes in the town of Ras al-Ain on the Turkish border after rebels claimed control. The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 40 Syrian soldiers were killed in the town, citing a doctor. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Under pressure from its donors Syria's opposition looks poised to agree to forming a new broad-based Syrian National Initiative at a fractious conference in Doha. 'We will not leave today without an agreement,' a source told Reuters. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • In a full version of his defiant interview with Russia Today Bashar al-Assad insisted there is no civil war in Syria and that Syrians support him. He also denied his forces had committed war crimes, claimed al-Qaida was trying to carve out an Islamic state in Syria and likened Turkey's leader to an Ottoman ruler. Mustafa Sheikh, who heads the military council running the Free Syrian Army, said Assad had learnt nothing from recent history. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • At least 18 people were killed after an artillery attack hit a residential area in al-Quriyah close to the Iraqi border. Khudher Ali, a rebel fighter from the town told the Guardian: 'We recovered the bodies of 13 women, three children and two men. We do not know how many people are still under the debris.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Tokyo is to host the next meeting of the Friends of Syria - an international coalition which supports the Syrian opposition, AFP reports.

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The security measures kept many people from attending the Friday prayers of Sheik Isa Qassim, who denounced Bahrain's move earlier this week to revoke the citizenship of 31 activists and lawyers. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'The revoking of citizenship from honourable people is aimed at punishing those who have opposition views,' he told worshippers who managed to reach his mosque in a Shia district outside the capital, Manama.

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Khudher Ali, a rebel fighter with Al-Qa'qa'a brigade from the town, said the 'catastrophic massacre' took place a 9am. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Speaking to the Guardian's Mona Mahmood he said a residential areas was hit by mortars fired from al-Mayadin to the west. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We recovered the bodies of 13 women, three children and two men. We do not know how many people are still under the debris. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Our towns are shelled every day, but this is the highest number of casualties for months. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] There has been a dispute among rebel about whether to storm the artillery unit responsible. It is a step we have to take now. We have to surround the brigade and then storm it because they are shelling towns all the time. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We tried to storm the brigade many times but have been hampered by the shortage of ammunition. However we have recently received donations from expatriates and plan to buy more ammunition from Iraq and Turkey. Then we carry out the operation. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Civilians here are now donating everything to the rebels to buy ammunition so we can get rid of this brigade.

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 1.17pm GMT [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syrian opposition poised to unite [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Under pressure from its donors Syria's opposition looks poised to agree to forming a new broad-based Syrian National Initiative after its fractious conference in Doha, Reuters reports. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A source inside meetings that lasted into the early hours of Friday morning said members of the Syrian National Council, a group made up mainly of exiled politicians, had shifted views and were coming to accept the need to form a wider body. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'We will not leave today without an agreement,' the source said. 'The body will be the sole legitimate representative of the Syrian people. Once they get international recognition, there will be a fund for military support.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The new body would mirror the Transitional National Council that united the opposition to Muammar Gaddafi in Libya last year and then took power after he was ousted, the source suggested. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'They will create a 'temporary government', which could take control of embassies around the world and take Syria's seat at the UN, because the regime would have lost its legitimacy.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] An outline agreement could see the SNC and other opposition figures agree on a 60-member political assembly, or congress, as well as a military and a judicial council. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The SNC, which has previously been the main opposition group on the international stage, may have around a third of the seats in the new body but would otherwise lose much of its influence. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Though it was not yet clear whether the groups meeting in Doha will name members to the new body or broach the thorny issue of its leadership, its creation would mark an advance long sought by the United States and Qatar. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Qatar's prime minister told delegates on Thursday to 'get a move on' in a closed meeting in a Doha five-star hotel. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'The Qataris are not to going to let them leave here in failure after all this investment,' said a diplomatic source on the sidelines of the Doha meetings. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 1.03pm GMT [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'Assad faces same fate as Gaddafi' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Bashar al-Assad faces the same fate as Muammar Gaddafi after vowing, like the Libyan leader, to die in his country, a rebel commander told the Guardian. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Assad told Russia Today 'I have to live in Syria and die in Syria.' His remarks echoed Gaddafi's February 2011 pledge to 'die as a martyr at the end'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Mustafa Sheikh, who heads the military council running the Free Syrian Army, said Assad had learnt nothing from recent history. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Speaking to the Guardian's Mona Mahmood, he said: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] I can't believe Bashar hasn't learnt the lesson of Gaddafi's fate. Gaddafi was bought down by his own arrogance and his denial of the Libyan revolution. He could not see it until he was surrounded by it and it killed him. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Bashar wants to show the world that he is still defiant and steadfast but we all know that this is the disease of dictatorship. He thinks he can last forever and defy the rules of nature. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] But Sheikh welcomed Assad's pledge not to flee Syria because it would mean he would face justice. 'If he stayed in Syria it would be a favour from God, because he will be punished by the Syrian people,' Sheikh said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Sheikh revealed the rebel commanders had not yet been contacted by British officials after William Hague's announcement on Wednesday that the government planned to hold talks with armed groups in Syria. He said: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We know that UK has the intention to hold talks with Syrian rebels regarding armaments, but nothing has happened yet. No one has contacted us so far. None of my colleagues who are in charge of other military brigades have told me that they have been contacted by the British authorities. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Sheikh confirmed that Free Syrian Army has restructured itself into five divisions. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] AFP said the division covered the north, south, east and west, and the coast, and that the FSA were about to elect new leaders. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'We are getting closer and closer to becoming organised, so that we can get to a stage that is accepted by the international community,' Sheikh told AFP. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 12.08pm GMT [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 9,000 Syrians crossed Turkey [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Whatever Feller and the UNHCR said to Turkey about opening its border to Syrians appears to have had a dramatic impact. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Last night a record 9,000 people came across the border, according to the UNHCR's Sybella Wilkes. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Last month Human Rights Watch said up 10,000 people have blocked at the Turkish border since restrictions were imposed in August. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] According to Turkish Govt, 9000 Syrians crossed into Turkey overnight @refugees #Syria [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] — Sybella Wilkes (@SybellaWilkes) November 9, 2012 [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 11.58am GMT [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Turkey 'stretched to the limit' with Syrian refugees, UN warns [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A top UN official has urged European countries to do more to tackle the Syrian refugee crisis as Turkey is 'stretched to the limit' with the numbers of people fleeing the violence. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] There are currently almost 400,000 refugees registered for assistance in the countries which neighbour Syria, a number the UN estimates will increase to 700,000 early next year. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Erika Feller, assistant commissioner for refugees at the UNHCR, told the Guardian that the number of refugees being allowed to cross into Turkey had to be staggered because there was no more capacity to cope with the increasing numbers. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] I do believe the European Union should do more ... Turkey would appreciate some international assistance which they don’t feel they are getting. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] It’s coping capacities are being stretched to the limit, therefore it would appreciate greater solidarity in the form of international aid and assistance coming directly to Turkey. It hasn’t been particularly heartened by the response to Turkey to date. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] I don’t believe they [Syrians] can be bussed to Europe, but I think there can be more focus on the sorts of programmes that are necessary to enhance the coping capacity of host countries: receiving children into the education; making the health system more accessible and responsive to the kind of problems that the Syrian population is bringing with them - the psycho-social and trauma type problems. [And] Shelter is a huge challenge. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Last month Human Rights Watch claimed Turkey and Iraq were unlawfully denying thousands of Syrians access to asylum by blocking their borders. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Feller has just returned from Turkey to discuss the issue. She said the UNHCR accepted Turkey’s insistence that its borders were open. But she added that the pace at which Syrians were being granted access to asylum was “to some extend consistent with its capacity to absorb”. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Turkish officials told Feller's team that it could not control who came across the border. She said: “There are other forces on the other side of the border who for whatever reason are blocking access to the border. It is too simplistic to say that if there are people waiting to come across that they are only waiting because Turkey is blocking them.” [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] At least 500 Syrians are crossing into Turkey each day, Feller said, which showed that is borders were open. And not all the Syrians who come to the border intend to cross it, she pointed out. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] During her visit, Feller reminded Turkish officials that insufficient capacity to house refugees could not be used as an excuse to block borders. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Any controls at the border have to be consistent with international refugee law. People who need it must have access to safety, and the principle of non-refoulement must be respected. We have no reason to doubt the sincerity of Turkey’s position that its border is open and will remain open. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We have said that if capacity is an issue and impacting the rate of arrivals we would be prepared to step in to assist to boost capacity. We have said that capacity should not be a reason for people being stuck at the border. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We have done our very best to encourage the borders to remains open and that people who are particularly vulnerable have a first priority if arrivals are going to be staggered. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Turkey has actually maintained a very generous response towards Syrian refugees having borne the brunt of the burdens of responsibility of hosting a very large number of people. This does not come without a price. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] There are currently 111,890 Syrians registered as needing help in Turkey. The Turkish government estimates there are a further 70,000 Syrians living in urban areas who are not registered. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Feller said the UNHCR did not wish to publicly criticise Turkey for issues at the border because it accepted that the Ankara government was doing all it could. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The UNHCR is also urging the Iraqi authorities to open its partially blocked border, she said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] On a visit to Jordan, Feller witnessed Syrian refugees, including a man who had been shot, coming across the border at night. She said she was “very impressed” with the way the Jordanian military was handling refugee crisis. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] But Feller said there were “issues” with border officials blocking access to single males over security concerns. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Feller said the refugees in overcrowded camps was the visible face of the crisis but a “hidden emergency” was developing away from the camps. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Whilst I’m not underestimating the challenges for people living in camps. I would really strongly encourage the international community to also turn its attention to the plight of the urban refugees from Syria. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 9.09am GMT [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Assad: 'there is no civil war in Syria' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Bashar al-Assad insists there is no civil war in Syria and that Syrians support him. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In a full version of his defiant interview with Russia Today, he said: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We do not have a civil war. It is about terrorism and the support coming from abroad to terrorists to destabilize Syria. This is our war ... [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The problem is not between me and the people; I do not have a problem with the people because the United States is against me and the West is against me and many other Arab countries, including Turkey which is not Arab of course, are against me. If the Syrian people are against me, how can I be here? [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] He claimed al-Qaida was trying to create an 'Islamic emirate in Syria where they can promote their own ideology in the rest of the world'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Assad also likened Turkey's prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan to an Ottoman ruler. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Erdogan thinks that if Muslim Brotherhood takes over in the region and especially in Syria, he can guarantee his political future, this is one reason. The other reason, he personally thinks that he is the new sultan of the Ottoman and he can control the region as it was during the Ottoman Empire under a new umbrella. In his heart he thinks he is a caliph. These are the main two reasons for him to shift his policy from zero problems to zero friends. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] And he claimed Syria was supported by many Arab countries including Iraq, Algeria and Oman. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Asked whether he would still be in power in 10 years time, Assad said: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] I see myself through my country; I cannot see myself but my country in ten-years’ time.

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Here's a roundup of the latest developments: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syria [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The UN has warned that the number of people inside Syria needing humanitarian aid could rise sharply from 2.5 million now to 4 million by early next year, AP reports. John Ging, operations director for the UN humanitarian office, said the UN was also forecasting that the number of refugees fleeing the violence will increase to 700,000 by early 2013. Speaking ahead of Friday’s fifth Syria humanitarian forum in Geneva, Ging said: “People need to be aware of just how desperate the situation is inside Syria for the people there ... It’s just getting a lot worse very rapidly for the ordinary people.” [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • President Bashar al-Assad has vowed to 'live and die in Syria'. In an interview with Russia Today, Assad made clear he had no intention of fleeing abroad – days after David Cameron suggested he could be offered 'safe passage' if he stepped down. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The opposition Syrian National Council appeared uncertain about supporting a new US-backed opposition coalition the Syrian National Initiative aimed at unifying the group, the National reports. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Emblematic of the disharmony, talks here were juggled between two separate hotels yesterday. While the SNC stayed in the Ritz Carlton, those set to discuss the US-backed initiative moved to the Sheraton, about a 20-minute drive away. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Foreign delegations attending the meeting in the Sheraton Hotel, including heads of the Arab League and Gulf Cooperation Council, as well as foreign ministers from Turkey and Qatar, sent a 'strong call for unity' using 'stark language', said one diplomat. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'Infighting among Syrians and power positioning is too strong to be subject to the whims of international powers,' warned Michael Stephens of Doha's Royal United Services Institute. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • But opposition leaders in Doha insists they have made progress towards forming the new leadership body proposed by prominent dissident Riad Seif, the BBC reports. Veteran opposition figure Haytham al-Maleh told AFP news agency: 'We hope we can reach an agreement [on Friday] after the Syrian National Council has succeeded in selecting a new leadership.' Burhan Ghalioun, ex-leader of the SNC outside Syria, said the atmosphere was 'positive' and that failure was 'forbidden'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Tokyo is to host the next meeting of the Friends of Syria - an international coalition which supports the Syrian opposition, AFP reports. Japan said around 150 envoys from some 60 countries are expected to attend the conference later this month. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • A rebel commander claims the Free Syrian Army has captured Ras al-Ain on the Turkish border, in a push to seize control of frontier areas, Reuters reports. The crossing is important because it opens another line to Turkey, where we can send the wounded and get supplies,' said Khaled al-Walid, a commander in the Raqqa Rebel Division. The Kurdish Council, a coalition of Kurdish parties opposed to Assad, called on the Free Syrian Army to leave Ain al-Arab, saying the clashes, as well as fear of Syrian army bombardment, had prompted most of the town's 50,000 inhabitants to flee. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Small acts of petty humiliation and atrocities like executions have led many Syrians to conclude that some rebels are as depraved as the government they fight, the New York Times reports. “All the ugly stuff the regime practiced, the FSA is copying,” a finance worker in Damascus, told the paper. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Nato deployment of patriot missiles on the Turkish-Syria would be aimed at placating Turkey and does not signal the start of western intervention in Syria, according to analysts Steven Cook and Michael Koplow. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] By making it seem as if a no-fly zone is a fait accompli, Ankara is hoping to create enough momentum to spur some real action. Yet rather than respond to the Turkish government’s posturing and efforts to shame the United States and NATO into taking Turkey’s preferred course, Ankara’s allies have sought to placate it with a symbolic dispatch of largely useless weapons ... [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] If scattering Patriot missile batteries along the Turkish-Syrian border is the price of keeping Turkey temporarily happy, it’s a pretty small price to pay, and certainly nothing compared to the cost of actually intervening in Syria. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Iran [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Iranian fighter jets fired on a US drone over the Persian Gulf last week in what is believed to be the first attack of its kind. The Predator drone, which was reportedly unarmed, photographed the 1 November incident with still and video cameras, Pentagon officials told CNN, which first reported the attack.

world/2011/jun/02/syria-uprising-clashes-assad,2011-06-02,Syrian uprising leaves 13 more dead as protesters dismiss amnesty offer,"Syria's bloody uprising has claimed 13 more victims when government forces shelled the central town of Rastan in a continuing offensive that belied offers of an amnesty for regime opponents. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Reports from Rastan and nearby Talbisa, north of Homs, described mosques and shops being hit by shellfire. Al-Jazeera reported 60 dead since Sunday in Rastan alone. Talbisa was said to be under siege by tanks, helicopters and snipers. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Further violence seems likely on Friday as protesters mark a 'children's Friday' in memory of Hamza al-Khatib, a 13-year-old boy who was killed in the Deraa area and whose battered and mutilated corpse has become a rallying-point for anger at the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Ammar Qurabi, head of the Syrian Organisation for Human Rights, referred to the names of 1,113 civilians killed since the protests erupted on 18 March. International media are banned by a government which talks of facing 'armed terrorist gangs' not largely peaceful protests. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syria's uprising is rapidly becoming one of the bloodiest episodes of the Arab spring – and there is no sign that Assad is likely to be overthrown. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Opposition groups reacted sceptically to an announcement of a conditional amnesty under which hundreds of detainees would be freed. Crucially, it is not clear if the authorities intend to release all the 10,000 or more people they are believed to have detained in the past 10 weeks and the thousands who were in jail before that. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Like other gestures made by Assad since the unprecedented crisis began, this was seen as too little and too late to defuse demands for an end to the regime. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Activists meeting in the Turkish town of Antalya called on the president to step down. 'The delegates have committed to the demands of the Syrian people to bring down the regime and support the people's revolution for freedom and dignity,' said a communique issued by 300 delegates at the conclusion of a two-day meeting that brought together opposition groups, activists and independent figures from inside Syria and abroad. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The hope is to raise international awareness of the scale of the repression, but there is still no sign of significant concerted action against Damascus beyond sanctions imposed by the US and EU. Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, again left open the possibility that Assad may yet change tack. 'The legitimacy that is necessary for anyone to expect change to occur under this current government is, if not gone, nearly run out,' she told reporters. 'If he's not going to lead the reform, he needs to get out of the way,' she said. 'Where he goes, that's up to him.'","Ian Black, Middle East editor",The Guardian

world/middle-east-live/2011/dec/09/syria-homs-massacre-warning-live-updates,2011-12-09,Syria: Homs massacre warning - Friday 9 December 2011,"4.25pm GMT / 11.5am EST: Here's a summary of today's events: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syria [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Turkey has warned it will act to protect itself if Syria's crackdown on protesters threatens regional security and a refugee crisis. Turkish foreign minister Ahmet Davutoglu said: 'Turkey has no desire to interfere in anyone's internal affairs. But if a risk to regional security arises, then we do not have the luxury of standing by and looking on.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Activists claim 35 people were killed as the security services attempted to prevent Friday protest in many parts of the country. Some protesters expressed support for a campaign civil disobedience, dubbed strikes for dignity, which is due to begin on Sunday. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The city of Homs witnessed the worst of the violence with 18 deaths. The opposition Syrian National Council claimed the Army is preparing to launch an onslaught against the city in an attempt to crush the centre of the uprising. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • More than 5,000 people have been killed in Syria since the uprising began in March, according to a tally by activists which is believed to be used by the United Nations. The estimate by the Violation Documentation Centre, includes 310 children and 910 soldiers. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The UN's deputy humanitarian chief Valerie Amos said the international community couldn't establish buffer zones in Syria, because it doesn't know where to set them up. She appealed again to the Syrian authorities to UN unfettered assess the scale of the crisis. The International Committee of the Red Cross said the humanitarian situation in Syria is serious but the country has not yet descended into civil war. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Syrian cartoonist Ali Ferzat, who was beaten by the security forces in August, has been named reporter of the year, by Reporters Without Borders and Le Monde. President Bashar al-Assad claimed this week to have no knowledge of his case. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The Arab League has asked Syria's ally Iraq to try to persuade Damascus to sign a deal that would grant monitors unfettered access in Syria. League general secretary Nabil al-Arabi said: 'The ball is in the Syrian court, they can come and sign at any time and then perhaps the observers will be there perhaps in 24 hours.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Libya [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The new Libyan authorities are making it difficult for journalists to report on the post-Gaddafi era by restricting media visa, journalists have complained. The National Transitional Council acknowledged the problem amid mounting media frustration at the lack of access. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Yemen [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • A prison riot in the capital Sanaa left two inmates dead and three guards injured. A prison protest at poor treatment turned violent after police tried to disperse the crowd by using water cannons and tear gas. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 3.37pm GMT / 10.37am EST: Doves or pigeons were released at a big demonstration Deir Balba in Homs province. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The blog Enduring America says they symbolize freedom. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In the city of Homs an activist shows how dodge sniper fire. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The number of people killed in the city has increased to 18 today, according to the LCCS. It says 32 people have been killed nationwide today. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 3.12pm GMT / 10.12am EST: Today's death toll in Syria appears to be rising ominously fast. According to the latest update from the Local Coordination Committee of Syria 29 people have died so far today, including six children. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Two people were killed in the Damascus suburbs of Saqba and Douma. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Video footage from another suburb of the capital, Qabon, shows a heavy security presence. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 2.39pm GMT / 9.39am EST: More than 5,000 people have been killed in Syria since the uprising began, according to a tally by activists which is believed to be used by the United Nations. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Violation Documentation Centre, a website maintained by activists aimed at counting and identifying the dead, reports that 5,008 people have been killed in the violence since March. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Last week the UN high commissioner for human rights, Navi Pillay, suggested that that UN was using the VDC for its estimates of the death toll in Syria. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] At the start of week she warned that 4,000 people and probably 'much more' had been killed in uprising. She updated journalists last Friday to say that 310 children were among the total - a figure that matched the VDC's tally at the time. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The number of children killed has since increased to 340, according to the VDC. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] There has also been a sharp rise in the number of troops killed from 843 this time last week to 910 today. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 2.09pm GMT / 9.09am EST: Syrian actor Fadwa Sulaiman has been filmed leading a demonstration in Homs, al-Jazeera's Evan Hill has spotted. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In a video message last month Sulaiman said: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] I urge the great Syrian people to continue their peaceful struggle until they topple the regime and achieve the democratic civic state that all Syrians dream of. And I invite you to unite and stand together to overthrow the regime which lost its legitimacy the moment the constitution was changed to accommodate the appointment of Bashar Al-Assad as president of Syria, for no reason other than being the son of the late president. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Her appearance in today's clip suggests she has abandoned a hunger strike and felt safe enough in Homs to come out of hiding. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 2.01pm GMT / 9.01am EST: The UN's humanitarian deputy chief Valerie Amos said the international community couldn't set up buffer zones in Syria, because it doesn't know where to set them up. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'If we don't know where the needs are, where are we going to set up possible humanitarian corridors or buffer zones?' she told reporters in Stockholm. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] She again urged the Syria government to grant humanitarian access to the country. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] I repeat my call to the Syrian government to really let us in. We are concerned about the health impact of what is going on. We don't have a very clear picture across the country because we do not have the access that will enable us to know exactly what is going on. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] If, as the government say, they have nothing to hide, then I think allowing us in to see that that is the case and to do a proper assessment of what the implications of this are for the people of Syria is absolutely critical. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 1.45pm GMT / 8.45am EST: Activists claim 15 people have been killed so far today in Syria, including four children, two women and four defected soldiers. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Seven people have killed in Homs, according to the Local Coordination Committee of Syria. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Such a figures have become grimly typical over the last few weeks. There has been so sign yet of a massacre in Homs , as the Syrian National Council feared. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Pockets of protests have continued in the city despite reports of troops and tanks surrounding Homs. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 1.02pm GMT / 8.02am EST: Despite the continuing crackdown protests have taken place across Syria today. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] This was the scene in Anadan, Aleppo and Zabadani near Damascus. In Kafranbel, Idlib protesters held up a placards of Assad as the Godfather. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In this demonstration in Ma'arrat an Numaan, protesters held a banner in English which read: 'All the massacres in the world doesn't compare with Assad's one'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A second banner appears to be an appeal to the UN's security council. 'We ask to move the Syrian file to the security commission,' it says. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 12.35pm GMT / 7.35am EST: Three children have been killed in Homs today, an activist and resident of the city told the Guardian. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Omar [not his real name] spoke to my colleague Mona Mahmood via Skype above the sound of gun fire. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] He said: 'The plan was to go an anti-regime demonstration after Friday prayers. But we were stopped by snipers at checkpoints. They were shooting anyone in the streets. So we decided to go to via alleys to avoid the shooting.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] He said the heaviest gunfire was in the districts of Khalediya and Bayada. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Omar said three have been killed today including 10-year-old Maher Al-Hussain in Bab Sebaa and 12-year-old Mohammed Nassar. Both were killed by cross fire from snipers he said. A third child was shot in al-Houleh, he said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The army continues to bombard the city with sound bombs and nail bombs, he claimed. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Omar, who was put in touch with the Guardian by the campaign Avaas, also described how the city is suffering from shortages of fuel, medication and power cuts. He said he knew of two women who died because of lack of medication. One had diabetes, the other kidney failure. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The price of infant milk formula had risen by 80%, he claimed. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Many of the flats in the city lack water because power cuts mean there is no electricity to pump it to the higher floors. Omar said he had to store bottled water on his balcony. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The city is in open revolt, Omar claimed. He said three quarters of the city's [NEW PARAGRAPH] schools and universities were closed and civil servants were on strike twice a week. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] There were chants calling for the execution of president Assad today, he said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] But added: 'We want to prove to the regime that our revolution is peaceful.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] He said the five provinces Deraa, Idlib, Dier Ezzor, Homs, and Hama as well as some Damascus suburbs, were prepared to support a new campaign of civil mutiny beginning on Sunday. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 11.45am GMT / 6.45am EST: The new Libyan authorities are making it difficult for journalists to report on the post-Gaddafi era by restricting media visa, journalists have complained. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Peter Bouckaert, emergencies director at Human Rights Watch, said the National Transitional Council has suspended a system which granted reporters entry to the country if they had letter from the NTC's media centre.. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] He complained that the new restrictions were a 'nasty' hangover from the Gaddafi era. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Writing on a Facebook group for foreign correspondents set up by Bouckaert, the Guardian's Libya stringer Christopher Stephen wrote: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] I spoke to the BBC and it is also their understanding that no more press visas will be issued as policy, with some exceptions made. One piece of advice was to come in on a business visa but this seems to me to be a non starter, because as soon as you write a story that meets official disapproval you will be reminded that you came in on a false visa. The NTC press office is closed, more or less permanently. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The NTC's deputy head of the media centre acknowledged the problem. In a posting on the group, he wrote: 'As all know things here are very slow and with the new gov[ernment] still in limbo it is proving problematic to get anywhere. But I will be persistent. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Bouckaert replied: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] What would be most useful is for the NTC to send a general instruction to embassies to provide visas for journalists and NGO workers, UN workers, and humanitarians who present their credentials at the embassy. The requirement to get approval from Tripoli is a nasty holdover from the Gaddafi era, and should be gotten rid off. There is no reason to require approval from Tripoli for accredited persons, and it just creates more work for you all. Happy journalists are an asset to the new Libya, and should be welcomed. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 10.56am GMT / 5.56am EST Syrian cartoonist Ali Ferzat, who was beaten by the security forces in August, has been named reporter of the year, by Reporters Without Borders and Le Monde. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] As Enduring America notes the Reporters Without Borders secretary-general Jean-François Julliard said: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] This year we are honouring a courageous journalist who has been the victim of brutal repression by an obsolete government Ali Ferzat fully deserves this award. His cartoons target the abuses of a desperate regime with its back to the wall and encourage Syrians to demand their rights and to express themselves freely. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Egyptian photographer ghazalairshad produced this Flickr gallery of Cairo exhibition of Ferzat's work and cartoonists response to his treatment. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] President Assad was asked about Ferzat in his interview with ABC's Barbara Walters. He denied knowledge of the case. Here's the transcript. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Walters: The cartoonist who was critical of you, I have seen his pictures, his hands were broken, he was beaten. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Assad: Many people criticize me, did they kill all of them, who killed who, most of the people that have been killed are supporters of the government not the vice versa. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Walters: But in the beginning, what about the singer with his throat cut? [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Assad: I don't know about him, I don't know about every single case. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 10.36am GMT / 5.36am EST: Activists claim the Free Syrian Army [FSA] destroyed one of the army tanks circling around Homs. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Footage of the incident from yesterday shows what appears to be a smouldering military vehicle in the city. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A report by the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a group that publicises protests, said the FSA was protecting civilians in the city with 'light weapons'. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 10.10am GMT / 5.10am EST: The humanitarian situation in Syria is serious but the country has not yet descended into civil war, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Reuters reports: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] ICRC President Jakob Kellenberger said the independent agency would not visit any more Syrian prisons until authorities fully accepted its terms but talks continued following its first ever visit to a Damascus detention centre in September. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Asked whether the situation in Syria now counted as a civil war under international law, Kellenberger told a news conference 'No, not yet. I'm in discussion with our legal people and I think they feel it does not yet qualify according to our criteria.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'But ... the qualification as such does not say much about the humanitarian suffering in a specific situation. It is an extremely serious humanitarian situation. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'So the fact that we have not yet qualified it as such is not a specific judgment on what we feel about the violence and its humanitarian consequences. It remains an issue basically because of one of the criteria -- that is that of organization.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] On the diplomatic front, France, Britain and Germany have called for UN Human Rights chief Navi Pillay to brief the UN security council on Syria's crackdown. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Al-Jazeera reports: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Diplomats from the three countries said they were ready to force a vote on the move at the 15-member council if a briefing was not agreed by consensus. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A final decision on Pillay's briefing will be made on Friday and the UN Human Rights commissioner could appear before the council next Tuesday, diplomats said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Arab League has asked Syria's ally Iraq to try to persuade Damascus to agree sign a deal that would grant monitors unfettered access in Syria. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] China Daily quoted League general secretary Nabil al-Arabi (pictured) as saying: 'The ball is in the Syrian court, they can come and sign (the initiative) at any time and then perhaps the observers will be there perhaps in 24 hours ... if they want to stop the economic sanctions, they (have to) sign' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 9.53am GMT / 4.53am EST: There is mounting concern about what is about to occur in Homs. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syrian blogger Maysaloon tweeted: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] I think we're either going to see a massacre in Homs, or a war involving #Syria at some point. This situation cannot last for long. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The Local Coordination Committee of Syria reported 'intensive fire' in the north east district Khalediya and Bayada districts. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] This map of protests areas in Homs is useful. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 9.40am GMT / 4.40am EST: The most cited source on events in Syria lives in a terraced house in Coventry where he combines monitoring the Assad regime's brutal crackdown with running a clothing business, Reuters reports. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] It has fascinating profile of Rami Abdulrahman founder of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] With only a few hours sleep, a phone glued to his ear and another two ringing, the fast-talking director of arguably Syria's most high-profile human rights group is a very busy man. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'Are there clashes? How did he die? Ah, he was shot,' said Rami Abdulrahman into a phone, the talk of gunfire and death incongruous with his two bedroom terraced home in Coventry, from where he runs the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] When he isn't fielding calls from international media, Abdulrahman is a few minutes down the road at his clothes shop, which he runs with his wife. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Cited by virtually every major news outlet since an uprising against the iron rule of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad began in March, the observatory has been a key source of news on the events in Syria. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Most foreign media have been banned from reporting in Syria. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'The calls come 24 hours a day, you've seen how many I've had in the last hour,' Abdulrahman, 40, told Reuters as he answered reporters' calls, as well as calls from his network of sources in Syria. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'My job, my clothing business, my nerves have all been affected due to the pressure. Some nights I only get three hours sleep,' he said. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 8.36am GMT / 3.36am EST: Welcome to Middle East Live. The central Syrian city of Homs is the focus today as the opposition fears the army is about to launch an assault on the city in an attempt to snuff out the uprising. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Here's a round up of the latest developments: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syria [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The Syrian army has surrounded Homs and is preparing to launch a 'massacre' according to a warning from the opposition Syrian National Council. In a press statement it said: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Evidence received from reports, videos and information obtained by activists on the ground in Homs, indicate that the regime paving the way to commit a massacre in order to extinguish the Revolution in Homs and to discipline by example, other Syrian cities that have joined the Revolution. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] It claimed that yesterday's attack on oil pipeline on the outskirts of Homs is being used as pretext for the assault. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • A series of videos from activists show tanks mobilising in and around the city, dissident Ammar Abdulhamid notes. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In a blogpost headline 'Prelude to Mayhem' Abdulahamid warns: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Unless world leaders make up their mind and decide that intervention to prevent a crisis is better than intervention to manage, the powder keg that is today's Syria will surely blow and soon. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Soldiers and activists close to the rebel Free Syrian Army are frustrated by the defensive tactics adopted by the group after talks with the opposition Syrian National Council, according to the New York Times. Abdulsatar Maksur, who helps supply the renegade troops, said: helping to coordinate the Free Syrian Army's supply network, said: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We don't like their strategy. They just talk and are interested in politics, while the Assad regime is slaughtering our people. We favor more aggressive military action.

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Egypt [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • Egypt's new parliament is on course to have no female representatives because the electoral system made it very difficult for women to win, argues Mara Revkin in Foreign Policy magazine. She writes: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] At face value, the requirement that each party include a woman on its list looks like a step toward leveling the playing field. But in reality, forcing parties to nominate women has done no favors for female candidates. Parties have dealt with the gender requirement by relegating women to the least desirable slots at the bottom of their candidate lists. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] When Salafi parties were required to include women on their candidate lists, they made sure that the candidates' faces were replaced with flowers on campaign materials, because displaying photos of women in public was deemed inappropriate. If the Salafis are already censoring posters, their parliamentarians aren't likely to look favorably on the participation of women in public and political life. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The Muslim Brotherhood is to boycott an advisory council in protest at the ruling general's decision to give the body the final say on writing the country's new constitution. The Brotherhood accused the generals of trying to undercut the authority of the elected representatives before the house had been fully elected.

He makes these points about Scaf's press conference: [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The oddness of making this important statement — the drawing of a red line — to foreigners rather than Egyptian politicians or even the Egyptian public [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • That the Scaf has chosen to make this statement indirectly suggests it does not feel confident for a direct confrontation (as over the 'supra-constitutional principles') and prefers sending signals at this state [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • That this is happening as the new government and its 'council of advisors' is being composed, with this council being given powers to guide the appointment of the members of the constituent assembly (a further distancing of Scaf from direct implication in this issue after the failure of the 'principles') [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The nonsensical nature of what was said — particularly the idea that the elected parliament does not represent Egyptian society, with the implication that the unelected Scaf does represent that society [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • The duelling constitutional challenges of the next few months: on the one hand, parliament seems to have the right to appoint the constituent assembly, but SCAF wants to guide the process; and on the other, SCAF seems to have the right to appoint the government, but the incoming parliament (and Tahrir) want to have a voice in that [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Bahrain [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] • There are growing doubts about the Kingdom's commitment to implement reforms set out by an independent inquiry into the government's handling of the uprising, the BBC reports.

[NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] For government loyalists, the report was like a bucket of cold water. It effectively told them that they had been lied to. The government's narrative was largely debunked: there was no Iranian involvement, the demonstrations were peaceful, the demands of the opposition are legitimate and did not call for an Islamic republic, military tribunals were wrong, and yes, there was not just systematic but systemic torture. Yet the report adopted the government narrative in some parts, particularly in the chapter about the raids at Salmaniya Hospital and the one about the crackdown at the University of Bahrain, two of the most contentious events.

world/2011/dec/13/syria-torture-evidence,2011-12-13,Syria's torture machine,"Between bursts of machine-gun fire and the crump of explosions – unmuffled in crisp mountain air – the starry sky above the Syrian frontier offers ethereal distraction. It's 3am and the town of Tal Kalakh, less than two miles to the north – just inside the Syrian Arab Republic – is under sustained attack, its residents reportedly refusing to hand over a small band of defectors who have holed up there, trying to bolt for Lebanon to join the insurgents. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] All around are mountains among which ancient armies have battled for millennia. And below, in besieged Tal Kalakh, a western outpost in the restive governorate of Homs, the Syrian army is once again hard at work, killing its own people. Tal Kalakh has felt the full force of violent repression many times since the Syrian revolt erupted back in March. One day, Tal Kalakh will doubtless appear on the revolutionary roll of honour. For now, this town of 80,000 people doesn't even merit a mention in my guidebook. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'We don't kill our people,' President Bashar al-Assad said last week in an American television interview. 'No government in the world kills its people unless it's led by a crazy person.' Those who dare oppose al-Assad do not think their leader crazy. Crazed, maybe. But today they see straight through him. They're tired of the lies. They have seen too much. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Between late November and early December, I was one of just two foreign reporters granted an official journalist visa to this repressive police state. I spent nine days in Damascus, capital of al-Assad's Republic of Fear, as a guest of the government. There, I encountered an angrily defiant regime, robust and resolute and unapologetic. Earlier in this Arab spring, I spent six weeks in Libya. There are echoes of Gaddafi in the personality cult surrounding al-Assad, but Syria's political and security apparatus is bigger and badder than anything Gaddafi could muster. I do not mean to belittle the suffering of Libyans, but Syria has four times the Libyan population and 10 times the menace. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Over the course of those nine days, I interviewed three government ministers, an army general and the mayor of a rebellious city. I heard nothing but denials that the security forces were shooting, shelling and torturing civilians. The government blames 'armed gangs' and 'terrorists' and invokes the spectre of Islamist insurgents, just as Gaddafi's henchmen did. And like them, they see western-backed conspiracies. They talk of a media war in which Arab and western satellite TV stations broadcast 'lies' and 'fabricated videos.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'Do you really think that we would accept torture?' I was asked by a seemingly incredulous Bouthaina Shaaban – presidential adviser and senior government minister – when I challenged her on the persistent allegations, most recently documented in great detail by the UN Human Rights Council's Independent Commission of Inquiry. 'Syria has no policy of torture whatsoever,' she said. 'We do not have Guantánamo or Abu Ghraib. That is absolutely unacceptable by us. Absolutely unacceptable.' Every government minister complained of the outside world's anti-Syrian agenda, which overlooked the barbarous excesses of 'armed gangs' that, they claimed, had tortured, killed and often dismembered 1,400 Syrian soldiers. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Syria is party to the 1984 UN Convention Against Torture. This convention defines 'torture' as any act which intentionally inflicts severe pain or suffering, physical or mental, with the intention of obtaining information, a confession or punishing an individual for something he or someone else has committed or is suspected of committing. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'It's rampant,' says Nadim Houry, the Beirut-based deputy director of Human Rights Watch for the Middle East and North Africa, who has taken testimony on hundreds of cases of torture from Syria, 'and, the odds are, if you're detained, you will be ill treated and most likely tortured. We know of at least 105 cases of people who were returned from the custody of security services in body bags to their loved ones … and those are only the ones that we know of.' Mr Houry says he has evidence that tens of thousands of Syrians have been arbitrarily detained over the months. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'But we have also documented what I would call 'meaningless torture' – if there is ever such a thing. They've got all the information but they want to teach you a lesson. I think that lesson is 'you need to fear us'. And the striking thing that I've seen is that despite that torture, people are no longer afraid. The wall of fear has been broken.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A short drive from the frontier, along hair-pinned mountain roads, past Lebanese checkpoints where friendly soldiers shiver, is a Syrian safe-house. There is no electricity. The place is crammed with refugees; there are children sleeping everywhere. In an upstairs room, next to a small wood-burner, a weathered former tractor driver from Tal Kalakh – who is in his 50s – winces as pains shoot through his battered body, lying on a mattress on the concrete floor. He manoeuvres himself on to a pile of pillows and lights a cigarette. He's relieved to have escaped to Lebanon but he's already yearning to go home. He can't though. His right leg is now gangrenous below the knee; he can barely move. So far he's had only basic medical treatment. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Before sunrise one morning, he told me, as troops laid siege to his town, he'd been shot twice by 'shabiha', pro-al-Assad militia. Unable to run, he had been rounded up, thrashed and driven down the road to nearby Homs with many other detainees, being beaten all the way. For the next few weeks, his bullet wounds were left to fester, he says, while he was subjected to torture so extreme that his accounts of what had happened to him left those of us who listened stunned and feeling sick. During his time in detention, he had been passed, he claimed, to five different branches of al-Assad's sadistic secret police, the Mukhabarat. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] In flickering candle-light, he told me in gruesome detail of beatings he'd received with batons and electric cables on the soles of his feet (a technique called 'falaka'). He had been hung by his knees, immobilised inside a twisting rubber tyre, itself suspended from the ceiling. He had been shackled hand and foot and hung upside down for hours – the Mukhabarat's notorious 'flying carpet'. Then hung up by his wrists ('the ghost'), and whipped and tormented with electric cattle prods. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] When he wasn't being tortured, he had been crammed into cells with up to 80 people, without room to sit or sleep, he claimed. They stood hungry, naked and frightened in darkness, in their filth, unfed, unwashed. He recalled the stench and listening to the screams of others echoing through their sordid dungeon. He told of being thrown rotting food. And of the sobbing of the children. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] 'I saw at least 200 children – some as young as 10,' he said. 'And there were old men in their 80s. I watched one having his teeth pulled out by pliers.' In Syria's torture chambers, age is of no consequence, it seems. But for civilians who have risen up against al-Assad, it has been the torture – and death in custody – of children that has caused particular revulsion. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The tractor driver told of regular interrogations, of forced confessions (for crimes he never knew he had committed); he spoke of knives and other people's severed fingers, of pliers and ropes and wires, of boiling water, cigarette burns and finger nails extracted – and worse: electric drills. There had been sexual abuse, he said, but that was all he said of that. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Having finished in one place, he'd been transferred to yet another branch of the Mukhabarat and his nightmare would start all over again. And as the beatings went on day in, day out, his legs and the soles of his feet became raw and infected. That was when they forced him to 'walk on rocks of salt'. He told me, speaking clearly, slowly: 'When you are bleeding and the salt comes into your flesh, it hurts a lot more than the beating. I was forced to walk round and round to feel more pain.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] He lit another cigarette, then said: 'Although we are suffering from torture, we are not afraid any more. There is no fear. We used to fear the regime, but there is no place for fear now.' If the intention of torture is to terrorise, it has in recent months had the opposite effect. Each act of brutality has served, it seems, to reinforce the growing sense of outrage and injustice and has triggered ever more widespread insurrection. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] I met other survivors in other safe houses and each account corroborated the other. A pharmacist, abducted by militia from a hospital to which he'd been taken after being shot. His experience of torture was every bit as bad as that of the tractor driver. The 16-year-old boy, beaten, electrocuted to the point he thought he would die, then threatened with execution. He was now having trouble sleeping. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Another man, placed in what he called 'the electric coffin' – in which a detainee is forced to lie inside a wooden box, across two metal plates through which they pass a current. The 73-year-old man was mercilessly whipped, electrocuted and beaten because of his son's known opposition activities abroad. He talked of hundreds of detainees pushed into cells, humiliated and naked. Another torture refugee told of a device they called 'the German chair', so named, apparently, because it was devised by the Stasi. In it, a detainee is bent backwards until he feels his spine will snap. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] What emerged was a pattern of systematic brutality, a revolving door of terror through which thousands of people have passed in recent months. This is Syria's torture machine. It is torture on an industrial scale. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] While in Syria, we lived in a bubble, seeing nothing of the extreme brutality and killing for which the Syrian regime is so notorious. We were taken to mass rallies, where thousands of frenzied supporters kissed portraits of al-Assad for our cameras and chanted slogans in defiance of Arab League sanctions. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] For two days we were not granted filming permits – and it's probably no coincidence that one of those days was a Friday, the day on which hundreds of anti-government demonstrations are guaranteed to break out right across the country after midday prayers. One day, while we were legally filming on a street, our government minder – despite wielding official documents embossed with Ministry of Information double-headed eagles – was arrested by angry Mukhabarat agents. We never found out why this particular location was so sensitive. Our minder returned, visibly shaken, 15 minutes later. 'We cannot film here,' he said. 'Let's go.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Despite daily requests, we were refused access to cities such as Homs and Hama whose residents were posting videos on YouTube showing tanks firing at random into civilian areas. When we were finally taken to Dara'a, the southern city that had been the cradle of this insurrection, we travelled in the presence of four government minders and, when we attempted to talk to anyone, we found ourselves surrounded by Mukhabarat who instructed our interviewees to tell us everything was normal. It was very claustrophobic. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Despite this, an astonishing number of Syrian people did approach us, subtly – and often quaking – to tell us that all was not as it appeared, that they detested the regime and that there were thousands out there like them. One man touched my arm as I stood in the midst of a mass rally in downtown Damascus, completely surrounded by the ranting and raging regime-faithful. As I looked round, he caught my eye and simply uttered the word 'Bashar' as he drew his index finger across his throat, before melting into the loyalist crowd. If he'd been spotted he might as well have signed his own death warrant. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] A road snakes up the barren rock of Mount Qasioun which overlooks Damascus and on a clear day, from 1,000m up, there's a magnificent panoramic view across the capital. From this vantage point, if you know what you're looking for, it is possible to pick out at least seven locations where you can say with a good degree of certainty that people are being tortured at any single moment. The thought spoils the view. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Each of the four main pillars of the Mukhabarat – military intelligence, air force intelligence, the political security directorate and the general security directorate – has its headquarters in the city. And each has sub-branches: general security has three – including the feared Palestine branch – and military intelligence has several, among them the notorious Branch 235. No one seems to know what the number means. Each of these agencies is an empire inside an empire, with bureaux the length and breadth of Syria. Since the revolt started, detention facilities have not been confined to known intelligence buildings; the Mukhabarat have used stadiums and football fields in several cities to detain and torture suspects. In smaller towns and villages, market squares suffice. The four main intelligence agencies are thought to be directly under the control of the president. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] While al-Assad increasingly faces armed insurrection from those weary of life in his Big Brother world, the most potent weapon in opposition hands is the mobile phone. Grainy footage of violent acts of repression – and of those tortured and killed by the regime – has been uploaded and rebroadcast to a global audience of millions. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] These videos make distressing viewing. In one, a mother is seen weeping over the body of her 27-year-old son who has been delivered home, dead, after a week in detention. He has marks and bruises all over his body and there is a bullet wound. 'May Allah take revenge against all tyrants,' the woman wails. 'On each and every unjust person, Bashar and his aides, my God, may You take revenge on him.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Such footage has caused irreparable damage to al-Assad's regime. But the government ministers I spoke to about these videos roundly dismiss them as faked or filmed somewhere else at another time. If verified, however, such footage would present important evidence of the crimes the regime now stands accused of by the UN Human Rights Council Inquiry. The sheer volume of such material – upwards of 30,000 videos have now been posted on the internet by Syrian opposition activists – spurred Channel 4 to commission a documentary investigation. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] We employed a team of experts to forensically examine video footage, subjecting it to a strict verification protocol. We have independently checked, when possible, the sources of the material, looked for time-specific clues, then examined location details with Syrians from those places. Specific incidents have been cross-checked and corroborated by independent sources. Exiled former members of the Syrian security forces have checked vehicles, uniforms and military insignia. A growing number of these videos show soldiers actually committing acts of torture, openly filming each other. It's chilling: not one of them appears to be worried about being identified. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Accents have been carefully listened to. And the records of those uploading video have been examined for consistency and reliability. We sought the advice of a specialist doctor from the charity Freedom from Torture. We employed a forensic pathologist, Professor Derrick Pounder, to examine grim video evidence of those whose relatives allege were killed under torture. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The result is a grotesque compendium of verified video material which we believe to present irrefutable prima facie evidence of crimes against humanity. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] Talking me through this material, Pounder said the videos show 'compelling evidence of crude physical violence, strangulation, homicide, shootings and general assaults. There is a very distinctive pattern of … physical violence in an extreme form,' he said. 'It would suggest that what was happening was happening on a wide scale and it would suggest that what was happening was carried out with impunity … There is no consequence for them even if there is clear evidence of an assault.' So much for the UN Convention Against Torture. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] One evening, when I was interviewing torture victims in a Syrian safe house in Lebanon, there was a great commotion. A Syrian army defector, who had commanded resistance in the district of Baba Amr in Homs – the city Syrians have dubbed 'Capital of the Revolution' – was being carried into the safe-house by four men. He had been shot nine times and had somehow survived, but he was in terrible pain. He had recently been smuggled into Lebanon from Tal Kalakh. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] The next morning, he was well enough to talk briefly. It was my first encounter with a former member of the Syrian security forces. He told me that mass detention and severe torture were commonplace. 'When the army carries out a detention campaign,' he said, 'they start to torture the detainee until the security services arrive. They then take him to the military security branch, which is like a human slaughter house. Most of the people taken there alive are discharged dead.' [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] While a platoon commander in the army he had accompanied officers in house-to-house searches for wanted men in Homs, he said. 'When they don't find their target, they either rape the women, or kill the children.' He named the officers in charge and his commanding officer. They were all Allawites, he said – members of the prominent Syrian Shia sect to which the president belongs. When they had failed to find one man on their wanted list, he claimed, they had taken his son, beheaded him and hung his head above the door of the family home. He related this account in a faltering manner as though struggling to find the words, and as he did so, tears rolled down his face. But he was so badly wounded, he couldn't wipe the tears away. This, he told me, was what had prompted his defection. [NEW PARAGRAPH]  [NEW PARAGRAPH] I told him that the UN had just raised its estimated death count to 4,000 civilians killed since March. (This week they raised that to 5,000.) He looked at me in disbelief. He said the number was much higher. After four decades of al-Assad rule, one man is held accountable for this bloody-thirsty repression: the army's commander-in-chief and the head of Syrian Intelligence – the president of the republic himself. And if al-Assad was to attempt to stop all this, could he, I asked Nadim Houry. 'I don't know the answer to that,' he said. 'But I do know that he never tried to stop it.'
